    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their come-from-behind win over the Dolphins, the Broncos traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for an AFC West rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. The Broncos jumped out to a 14-0 lead on their first two possessions in the first quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes &#8212; a 23-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and a 15-yarder to running back C. J. Anderson. A 22-yard field goal by placekicker Connor Barth increased the Broncos' lead to 17-0 early in the second quarter. The scoring play occurred after the Broncos' special teams fooled the Chiefs with a fake punt run by safety David Bruton and a fourth-down conversion by Anderson. The Chiefs got on the scoreboard later in the second quarter, with quarterback Alex Smith connecting on a 20-yard touchdown pass to tight end Anthony Fasano. The Broncos' offense subsequently marched down the field, but had to settle on a 24-yard field goal by Barth just before halftime. The Chiefs' defense forced a fumble off Manning deep in Broncos' territory on the Broncos' first possession of the second half, but had to settle on a 39-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. Barth added two more field goals &#8212; a 30-yarder midway through the third quarter and a 33-yarder early in the fourth quarter &#8212; to increase the Broncos' lead to 26-10. The first field goal came after a DeMarcus Ware interception of Smith on a deflected pass, while the second field goal came after Chiefs' cornerback Marcus Cooper muffed a punt. The Chiefs narrowed the Broncos' lead, with Smith throwing a 12-yard touchdown pass to running back Jamaal Charles. However, Broncos' safety T. J. Ward knocked away a two-point conversion pass from Smith intended for Fasano that would have brought the Chiefs to within a one-score deficit. Barth added one more field goal &#8212; a 37-yarder midway through the fourth quarter. The Broncos' defense subdued the Chiefs for the remainder of the game. With the win, the Broncos swept the Chiefs for a third consecutive season. Peyton Manning improved his personal record to 11-1 all-time in games against the Chiefs.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team had home field advantage?",
