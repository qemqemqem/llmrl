    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their road win over the Giants, the Vikings went home for a Week 13 divisional rematch with the Detroit Lions. In the first quarter, Minnesota scored first as RB Chester Taylor completed a 2-yard TD run. The Lions would reply with kicker Jason Hanson hitting a 37-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Minnesota answered with rookie RB Adrian Peterson getting a 16-yard TD run. Detroit would respond with QB Jon Kitna completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE/FB Casey Fitzsimmons. Afterwards, the Vikings immediately scored with rookie WR Aundrae Allison returning a kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown (a franchise best), while QB Tarvaris Jackson completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Bobby Wade and a 2-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. In the third quarter, Peterson added a 13-yard TD run. This was the first time since their 15-1 season of 1998 that they were able to get 40+ points in back-to-back games.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more yards did Peterson run in the first half than he did in the second half?",
