    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Chiefs played the defending AFC Champion New England Patriots, and were 16 &#189;-point underdogs entering the game. With 7:20 left in the first quarter, safety Bernard Pollard hit quarterback Tom Brady in his left leg. Brady went down, clutching his left knee and would not return to play in the game. Back-up quarterback Matt Cassel entered the game, and his first pass of the game went 51&#160;yards to wide receiver Randy Moss. Cassel continued to excel as he was 5-6 on the drive. It ended on a 10-yard touchdown pass to Moss, giving the heavily favored Patriots the early lead in the second quarter. Five drives later the Chiefs got on the scoreboard after a 13-play drive that ended on a 40-yard field goal from kicker Nick Novak. However, New England replied with their second touchdown of the day, this time a 5-yard run by running back Sammy Morris. Chiefs quarterback Brodie Croyle was hurt when he was sacked and slammed to the turf on his shoulder. With around 50&#160;seconds on the clock and down by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, the Chiefs had the ball near the Patriots goal line. Kansas City had a chance to score but Dwayne Bowe dropped a pass in the end zone on fourth down, leading the Patriots victory. The loss also gave them a franchise-worst 10-straight losses, dating back to last season.e tried to throw on the sideline, but immediately indicated he was through for the day. Damon Huard substituted for Croyle and had the Chiefs on the 5-yard line when they ran out of downs. The Patriots won the game 17-10, and the Chiefs fell to an 0-1 start.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many quarters did Brady play in?",
