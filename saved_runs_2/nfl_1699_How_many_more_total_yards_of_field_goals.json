    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Cardinals' third game was an Interconference duel with the Raiders. The Cardinals led early in the first quarter when RB LaRod Stephens-Howling returned a kickoff from his own goal line to the endzone running 102 yards for a touchdown. The Raiders replied and took the lead with QB Bruce Gradkowski completing a 22-yard touchdown pass to TE Zach Miller, followed by kicker Sebastian Janikowski making a 22-yard field goal. Arizona replied with kicker Jay Feely kicking a 42-yard field goal. Then the Raiders replied with Janikowski making a 54-yard field goal. The Cardinals took the lead in the 2nd quarter when QB Derek Anderson made a 2-yard TD pass to WR Steve Breaston, but it didn't last very long after RB Darren McFadden got a 2-yard TD run. Arizona got the lead back in the 3rd quarter when Anderson found WR Larry Fitzgerald on an 8-yard TD pass. In the 4th quarter Oakland cut the lead when Janikowski made a 23-yard field goal. Janikowski missed three field goals in the game, giving Arizona the win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more total yards of field goals did Sebastian Janikowski make than Jay Feely?",
