    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap their two-game losing streak, the 49ers flew to Lucas Oil Stadium for a Week 8 interconference duel with the Indianapolis Colts. This game would be quarterback Alex Smith's first start since November 12, 2007. In the first quarter, San Francisco struck first as running back Frank Gore got a 64-yard touchdown run. The Colts would answer with a 38-yard field goal from kicker Matt Stover. Indianapolis would begin the second quarter with Stover's 33-yard field goal, yet the Niners came right back with Smith's 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Vernon Davis. Afterwards, the Colts would close out the half with Stover nailing a 31-yard field goal. Indianapolis would take the lead in the third quarter as Stover nailed a 40-yard field goal, followed by running back Joseph Addai's 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne to begin the fourth quarter (with a failed 2-point conversion). San Francisco tried to rally, but the Colts' defense would shut down any possible comeback attempt.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Stover's longest field goal than his shortest?",
