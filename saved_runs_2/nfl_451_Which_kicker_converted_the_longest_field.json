    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their home win over the Texans, the Falcons flew to LP Field for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Tennessee Titans. In the first quarter, Atlanta got off to a fast start as CB DeAngelo Hall returned a LenDale White fumble 56 yards for a touchdown. The Titans tied the game with RB Chris Brown getting a 3-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Falcons regained the lead with kicker Morten Andersen getting a 32-yard field goal. Tennessee ended the half with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Atlanta got their lead back with Andersen kicking a 28-yard field goal. However, the Titans took the lead with Bironas nailing a 40-yard field goal, along with DB Vincent Fuller intercepting QB Joey Harrington and returning it 76 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, with Harrington being ineffective (16/31 for 87 yards and 1 interception), back-up QB Byron Leftwich came to try to lead the Falcons to victory. Near the end of the game, Atlanta came close (at Tennessee's 1-yard line). On four-straight plays, they were held out of the end zone, with Albert Haynesworth making a leaping tackle of Warrick Dunn in the backfield after hurdling an offensive lineman. With the loss, not only did the Falcons fall to 1-4, but it also marked their fifth straight loss to the Titans.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich kicker converted the longest field goal?",
