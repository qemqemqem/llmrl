I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking for the difference between the yardages of the two touchdowns by Andrew Luck. To answer the actual question, I should have realized that the only touchdown left to consider was the second touchdown by the Browns, which was a 33-yard pass from Brandon Weeden to Josh Gordon. Therefore, the longest touchdown of the game was 33 yards. In the future, I will make sure to read the question more carefully and consider all the relevant information before providing an answer.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns traveled to Indianapolis to take on an Andrew Luck-led Colts offense. The Colts were able to score in the first quarter as Andrew Luck ran for a 3-yard touchdown making the score 7-0 for the only score of the game. The Browns responded in the 2nd quarter coming within a point when Brandon Weeden found Greg Little on a 14-yard pass (with a failed PAT) making the score 7-6. Then, Luck ran for another touchdown this time from 5 yards out to make the score 14-6 at halftime. The Browns came within a point again in the 3rd quarter as Weeden found Josh Gordon on a 33-yard pass making the score 14-13 but the Colts wrapped things up with Adam Vinatieri's 38-yard field goal followed by a scoreless 4th quarter making the final score 17-13 as the Browns' road record at this point of the season was 0-4 while their record overall was 1-6.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown of the entire game?",
