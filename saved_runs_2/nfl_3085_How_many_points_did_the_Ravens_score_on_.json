After Browns' starting quarterback Robert Griffin III was injured in week 1, the Ravens faced Josh McCown who passed for 457 yards against them last season. After a dismal start in which the defense allowed 20 points in the first quarter, they bounced back with a blocked extra point for a safety, after which Joe Flacco and the offense finally returned with full strength, with two touchdown passes to Mike Wallace and three Justin Tucker field goals, shutting out the Browns 25-0 in the final three quarters.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Ravens score on special teams?",
