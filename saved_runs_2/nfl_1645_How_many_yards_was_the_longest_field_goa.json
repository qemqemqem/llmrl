Seattle would trail in the first quarter as Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, followed by running back Tim Hightower's 2-yard touchdown run. Arizona would increase its lead in the second quarter with a 29-yard field goal from kicker Neil Rackers. The Seahawks would then get on the board as kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 28-yard field goal. However, the Cardinals took control in the second half as Warner found wide receiver Steve Breaston on a 16-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, followed by Rackers' 31-yard field goal in the fourth. With the loss, Seattle went into their bye week at 2-4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
