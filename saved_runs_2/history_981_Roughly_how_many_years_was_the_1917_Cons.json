    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I carefully read through the passage and looked for any information about when the 1917 Constitution was reformed. I found that in the early 1990s, the government introduced reforms to the constitution, but the passage did not give an exact number of years that the constitution was in place before it was reformed. Therefore, I had to make an inference based on the information provided. Since the constitution was adopted in 1917, and the reforms were introduced in the early 1990s, I subtracted 1917 from 1990 to get 73 years. \n\nTo solve the problem better, it would have been helpful if the passage had provided an exact year or range of years for when the reforms were introduced. Additionally, it would have been useful to have a clearer indication of when the 1917 Constitution was first reformed, as this would have provided a clearer starting point for calculating the number of years it was in place before the next round of reforms.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nAn important element the Revolution's legacy is the 1917 Constitution. It was pushed forward by populist generals within Carranza's government to undermine the popular support that Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata held. It was not written by liberal elites or the military itself, but rather young radicalized professionals, giving the document some authenticity for the peasantry. The document brought numerous reforms demanded by populist factions of the revolution, with article 27 empowering the state to expropriate resources deemed vital to the nation. These included expropriation of hacienda lands and redistribution to peasants. Article 27 also empowered the government to expropriate holdings of foreign companies, most prominently seen in the 1938 expropriation of oil. In Article 123 the constitution codified major labor reforms, including an 8-hour work day, a right to strike, equal pay laws for women, and an end to exploitative practices such as child labor and company stores. The constitution strengthened restrictions on the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico. In the early 1990s, the government introduced reforms to the constitution that rolled back the government's power to expropriate property and its restrictions on religious institutions. Just as the government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari was amending significant provisions of the constitution, Metro Constituci\u00f3n de 1917 station was opened.\n\nQuestion:\nRoughly how many years was the 1917 Constitution in place before it was reformed?",
