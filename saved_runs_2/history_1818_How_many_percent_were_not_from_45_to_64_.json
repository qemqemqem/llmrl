To solve the problem, I first calculated the percentage of the population that was 62 years of age or older by subtracting 23.3% (the percentage of the population under 18) and 41.1% (the median age) from 100%. This gave me 35.6%. I then subtracted this percentage from 100% to get the percentage of the population that was not 45 to 64 years old, which is 81.3%.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully and realized that it was asking for the percentage of people who were not from 45 to 64, rather than the percentage of people who were 45 to 64.
