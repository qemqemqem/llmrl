    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye week the Dolphins flew to Lambeau field for an Interconference duel against the Packers. In the first quarter the Dolphins trailed early with kicker Mason Crosby nailing a 46-yard field goal. But they replied with QB Chad Henne making a 2-yard TD pass to WR Davone Bess. The lead didn't last very long after QB Aaron Rodgers made an 86-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings. The Dolphins tied the game in the second quarter with kicker Dan Carpenter hitting a 53-yard field goal. He also made a 41-yard field goal to put the Dolphins up 13-10. In the fourth quarter the Packers tied the game with Crosby making a 46-yard field goal, but the Dolphins got the lead back when Henne found TE Anthony Fasano on a 22-yard TD pass. Green Bay replied with Rodgers scrambling 1 yard to the endzone for a touchdown to put the game in overtime. After overtime, the decision was made when Carpenter successfully put away a 44-yard field goal to give the Dolphins the win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were successful of at least 50 yards?",
