In the first quarter the Chiefs trailed early as kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 20-yard field goal, followed by a 24-yard field goal in the second quarter. The Chiefs replied with kicker Ryan Succop nailing a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Colts increased their lead with Vinatieri's 47-yard field goal, followed by Succop's 35 and 43-yard field goals to tie the game. In the fourth quarter the Chiefs trailed slightly with Vinatieri getting a 42-yard field goal. After that, the Chiefs defense was finally broken down with RB Mike Hart getting an 11-yard TD run. With the loss, the Chiefs fell to 3-1 and it also marked the first time since 1970 where no teams start out 4-0.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich kicker scored fewer field goals over the course of the entire game?",
