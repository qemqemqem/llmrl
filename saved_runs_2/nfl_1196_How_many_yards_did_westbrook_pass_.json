    "problem_text": "Context:\nAndy Reid waited until Monday afternoon to name Donovan McNabb as his starter for a Thanksgiving Day matchup with the Arizona Cardinals.  On the opening drive, the Eagles marched down the field and scored on 5-yard touchdown pass up the middle to Brian Westbrook  After Joselio Hanson intercepted Kurt Warner, the Eagles scored again on four runs to Westbrook, the final one being a 1-yard burst up the middle.  In the second quarter, the Eagles increased their lead to 21-0 when McNabb hooked up with Westbrook again on a 2-yard touchdown pass.  The Cardinals would get on the board with a 1-yard TD pass to Larry Fitzgerald, but Philadelphia closed out the half with kicker David Akers getting a 42-yard field goal.  Westbrook scored his fourth touchdown on a 9-yard run in third quarter as Philadelphia made it 31-7.  Arizona capitalized on a muffed punt return by DeSean Jackson with a touchdown pass to Steve Breaston (with a failed 2-point conversion).  After a Philadelphia field goal, the Cardinals closed to 34-20 when Fitzgerald caught his second touchdown.  However, the Eagles pulled away for good with McNabb completing short touchdown passes to DeSean Jackson and Jason Avant.  With the win, Philadelphia improved to 6-5-1 and returned to the playoff hunt.  McNabb was 27-for-39 for 260 yards and four touchdowns, and Westbrook gained 110 yards rushing, scored two touchdowns on the ground, and two more in the air.  McNabb and Westbrook were both given NFL Network's 2008 Pudding Pie Award for their efforts.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did westbrook pass?",
