    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their tie with the Eagles, the Bengals flew to Heinz Field for a Week 12 AFC North rematch with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday Night Football.  Prior to the game, it was announced that due to arriving at a team meeting 45 minutes late and arguing with head coach Marvin Lewis, WR Chad Ocho Cinco was deactivated for the game. In the first quarter, Cincinnati struck first as QB Ryan Fitzpatrick completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Glenn Holt.  In the second quarter, the Steelers took the lead as QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Heath Miller, along with kicker Jeff Reed getting a 37-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Pittsburgh increased its lead as Reed made a 38-yard field goal, along with RB Gary Russell getting a 2-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals tried to rally as kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 26-yard field goal.  However, the Steelers pulled away with Roethlisberger's 8-yard TD run. With the loss, Cincinnati fell to 1-9-1. It was also the Bengals' 332nd loss since the originating of the AFC-NFC format in 1970, temporarily tying them with the New York Jets for the most all-time losses among AFC teams.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many is the difference in the number of yard pass to HOlt and the number of yards TD run by Russel?",
