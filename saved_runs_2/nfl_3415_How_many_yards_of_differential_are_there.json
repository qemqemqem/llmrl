To solve the problem, I first identified the two longest touchdown passes, which were the 59-yard pass to Torrey Smith and the 72-yard pass to Nelson Agholor. Then, I subtracted the length of the third longest touchdown pass from the length of the longest touchdown pass to get the difference in yards. However, I made an error in identifying the third longest touchdown pass, which led to my incorrect answer.\n\nTo solve the problem more accurately, I could have reviewed the game statistics to identify the length of each of the four touchdown passes and then calculated the difference between the longest and third longest passes.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Eagles scored early and often in this game, for their first blowout win of the season. Carson Wentz found tight ends Trey Burton and Zach Ertz for early touchdowns, and later connected with wide receiver Torrey Smith for a 59-yard touchdown to finish the first quarter. Following Smith's touchdown, the Eagles unveiled their baseball home run celebration for the first time all season. The closest the Cardinals came was in the second quarter when they trailed 21-7 following a John Brown 13 yard touchdown. In the mid third quarter, on 3rd and 19, Wentz found wide receiver Nelson Agholor for a 72-yard touchdown pass, on which Agholor juked rookie safety Budda Baker and finished the play with the Nestea Plunge. The final score was 34-7, and Wentz threw for four touchdowns, including three first quarter TD passes.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards of differential are there between the longest touchdown and the third longest touchdown?",
