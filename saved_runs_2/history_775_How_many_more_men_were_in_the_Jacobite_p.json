    "problem_text": "Context:\nSupport of episcopacy was strong in the north-east and became the centre of a Jacobite party led by John Graham of Claverhouse who had been made Viscount Dundee by James VII. Dundee raised a force that held Edinburgh Castle for the deposed king and then organised an army that was mainly made up of Highlanders. They were confronted in Perthshire by a force from the new government that was led by General Hugh Mackay, but in the ensuing Battle of Killiecrankie which took place on 27 July 1689 the government force was overwhelmed by the Jacobite Highlanders and defeated. However, the Jacobites sustained heavy losses as well, including their leader the Viscount Dundee. This victory raised the hopes of the Jacobite rebels, but their army of 5,000 men was defeated by government forces at the Battle of Dunkeld on 21 August 1689 by 1,200 men of the Cameronian Regiment . During the battle the leader of the government force, William Cleland, was killed and so command fell to Captain George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie who led them to victory. With the Jacobite defeat at Dunkeld, the rising was over.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more men were in the Jacobite party than in the Cameronian Regiment?",
