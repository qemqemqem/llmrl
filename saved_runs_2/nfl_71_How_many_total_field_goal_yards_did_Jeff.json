However, the problem asked for the total number of field goal yards he kicked, which includes the distance of each field goal multiplied by 3 (since each yard is 3 feet). \n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I should have multiplied the distance of each field goal by 3 and then added them up. \n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is:\n\n19 yards x 3 feet/yard = 57 feet\n45 yards x 3 feet/yard = 135 feet\n\nTotal field goal yards = 57 + 135 = 192 yards\n\nSo, the correct answer is 192. \n\nIn the future, I will make sure to read the problem more carefully and double-check my calculations to avoid making mistakes.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to end their three-game losing skid, the Panthers played their final home game of the year against the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers.  With QB Jake Delhomme's thumb still sore, Chris Weinke once again got the start.  After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina's recent struggles continued with QB Ben Roethlisberger's 1-yard TD run, kicker Jeff Reed's 19-yard field goal, and Roethlisberger's 13-yard TD pass to RB Najeh Davenport.  Afterwards, the Panthers got their only score of the game with kicker John Kasay getting a 37-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, more Panther trouble continued with Reed's 45-yard field goal and RB Willie Parker's 41-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, WR Santonio Holmes returned a punt 65-yards for a touchdown, while Josh Reed booted a 26-yard field goal.  With their fourth-straight loss, the Panthers fell to 6-8.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total field goal yards did Jeff Reed kick?",
