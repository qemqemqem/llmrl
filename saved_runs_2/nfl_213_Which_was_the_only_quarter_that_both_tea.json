    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Dolphins, still looking for their first win of the year, stayed at home for a Week 3 match-up with the Tennessee Titans.  Miami drew first blood in the first quarter with kicker Olindo Mare kicking a 40-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Dolphins got a bit of a scare as Titans QB Kerry Collins completed a 27-yard pass to TE Bo Scaife for a touchdown and the lead.  In the third quarter, Miami reclaimed the lead with QB Daunte Culpepper getting a touchdown on a 5-yard scramble.  However, the Titans didn't go down quietly, as kicker Rob Bironas kicked a 22-yard field goal for Tennessee, putting the game in a 10-10 tie.  Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, Mare finally helped Miami get win #1 with a 39-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich was the only quarter that both teams score during?",
