    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the Eagles the Giants flew to Lambeau Field for an NFC duel with the Packers. In the first quarter the Giants trailed early with QB Aaron Rodgers completing an 80 and a 3-yard TD pass to WR Jordy Nelson and to WR James Jones respectively. The Giants replied to tie the game with QB Eli Manning throwing a 36 and an 85-yard TD pass to WR Hakeem Nicks and Mario Manningham. They had further problems with FB John Kuhn getting an 8-yard TD run, followed by kicker Mason Crosby getting a 31-yard field goal. The Giants cut the lead with kicker Lawrence Tynes nailing a 38-yard field goal, but fell further behind with Rodgers completing a 1 and a 5-yard TD run to TE Donald Lee and to Kuhn respectively. This was followed by Kuhn getting a 1-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards difference exists between the longest field goal and the shortest?",
