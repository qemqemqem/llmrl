To solve the problem, I subtracted the birth year of Mary Follett (1868) from the death year of Henri Fayol (1925), which gave me 57. However, the question asked for the difference in the number of years that Fayol lived compared to Follett, so I should have subtracted Fayol's birth year (1841) from Follett's death year (1933), which gives a difference of 19 years. To solve the problem better, I should have read the question more carefully and paid attention to the specific information being asked for.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe first comprehensive theories of management appeared around 1920. The Harvard Business School offered the first Master of Business Administration degree (MBA) in 1921. People like Henri Fayol (1841-1925) and Alexander Hamilton Church (1866-1936) described the various branches of management and their inter-relationships. In the early-20th century, people like Ordway Tead (1891-1973), Walter Dill Scott (1869-1955) and J. Mooney applied the principles of psychology to management. Other writers, such as Elton Mayo (1880-1949), Mary Follett (1868-1933), Chester Barnard (1886-1961), Max Weber (1864-1920), who saw what he called the \"administrator\" as bureaucrat, Rensis Likert (1903-1981), and Chris Argyris (born 1923) approached the phenomenon of management from a sociology perspective.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years longer did Henri Fayol live compared to Mary Follett?",
