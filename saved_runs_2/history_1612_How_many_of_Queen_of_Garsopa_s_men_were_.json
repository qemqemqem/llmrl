In the middle of July 1571, during the monsoon, it was attacked by 5,000 men, and 400 horse of the neighbouring Queen of Garsopa, instigated by the Adil Shah of Bijapur, who provided 2000 of those men. The Viceroy dispatched 200 men to reinforce the fort by sea aboard a galley and eight foists. The small fleet managed to reach the fort despite the monsoon weather and immediately conducted a successful attack on the enemy army and the fort held on.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many of Queen of Garsopa's men were not provided by Adil Shah of Bijapur?",
