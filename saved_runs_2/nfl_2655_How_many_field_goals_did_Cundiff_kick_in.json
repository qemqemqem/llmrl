They drew first blood as Shaun Suisham nailed a field goal from 47 yards out to take a 3-0 lead.  The Browns managed to tie the game as Billy Cundiff helped them tie it at 3-3 in the first quarter.  In the 2nd quarter, the Steelers moved back into the lead scoring 24 unanswered points in the process.  Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 41-yard touchdown pass to make the score 10-3 followed by another Suisham field goal this time from 32 yards out to make the score 13-3 at halftime.  In the 3rd quarter, Roethlisberger found Emmanuel Sanders on a 4-yard touchdown pass increasing their lead to 20-3 followed by William Gay who picked off Brandon Weeden and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown making the score 27-3.  The Browns would score a touchdown of their own as Weeden found Josh Gordon on a 1-yard touchdown pass followed by a successful 2-point conversion pass to Davone Bess to make the final score 27-11 as the Steelers improved to 5-6 winning 3 straight and taking their trend to winning 5 out of their last 7.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Cundiff kick in the first half?",
