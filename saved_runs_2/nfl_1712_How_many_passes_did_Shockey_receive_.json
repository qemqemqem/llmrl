    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Cardinals the Falcons traveled to Louisiana Superdome for an NFC South rivalry match against the New Orleans Saints. The Falcons trailed early when QB Drew Brees made a 2-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. The Falcons replied with QB Matt Ryan making a 13-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez. The Saints re-took the lead with Brees finding WR Lance Moore on an 80-yard TD pass. But the Falcons replied in the second quarter driving 72 yards in 19 plays, taking 10:39 off the clock ending with RB Michael Turner plunging into the end zone on a 1-yard TD run. The Falcons took the lead when kicker Matt Bryant booted a 23-yard field goal. But they fell behind with Brees finding Moore again on a 16-yard TD pass. The Falcons we're able to retake the lead when Ryan rifled a 22-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. However, Drew Brees drove the Saints into field goal range and they would tie the game with kicker Garrett Hartley making a 32-yard field goal. In overtime, the Saints drove down to the goal line but kicker Hartley missed a 29-yard, chip shot field goal. Matt Ryan drove the Falcons back down the other direction and Matt Bryant hit a 46-yard field goal to give the Falcons the win. With the win, not only the Falcons improved to 2-1 but finally won their first game in New Orleans since 2002.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many passes did Shockey receive?",
