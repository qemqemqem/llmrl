In the first quarter, the Browns scored first as Brian Hoyer found Jordan Cameron on a 2-yard pass for a 7-0 lead.  In the second quarter, the Bengals scored when Mike Nugent nailed a 25-yard field goal for the eventual halftime score of 7-3.  In the third quarter, the Browns scored a field goal of their own when Billy Cundiff nailed one from 51 yards out giving them a 10-3 lead.  The Bengals once again came within 4 as Nugent kicked another field goal from 46 yards out for a 10-6 game.  In the fourth quarter, it was all Browns as Hoyer found Chris Ogbonnaya on a 1-yard pass for the eventual final score of 17-6.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player scored the last points for Browns in the game?",
