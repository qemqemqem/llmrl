The correct answer is that Brandon Weeden had a touchdown pass shorter than 40 yards. To solve the problem, I had to identify the players who threw touchdown passes in the game, determine the length of each touchdown pass, and identify which touchdown pass was shorter than 40 yards.

They would score first in the 1st quarter as Caleb Sturgis kicked a 45-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  They led 6-0 in the 2nd quarter after Sturgis kicked a 49-yard field goal.  The Browns got on the board and took the lead before halftime as Brandon Weeden found Jordan Cameron on a 7-yard pass for a 7-6 score.  After the break, the Phins went back to work and took the lead as Ryan Tannehill found Brian Hartline for a 34-yard pass and retook the lead 13-7.  The Browns then came within 3 as Billy Cundiff kicked a 39-yard field goal shortening the lead to 13-10.  In the 4th quarter it was all Dolphins and Daniel Thomas ran for a 1-yard TD making the score 20-10 while Sturgis kicked a 36-yard field goal for the final score of the game 23-10.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich players had touchdown passes shorter than 40 yards?",
