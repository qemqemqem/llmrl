    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off an impressive home win over the Buccaneers, the Lions flew to Soldier Field for Round 2 of their NFC North duel with the Chicago Bears.  After a scoreless first quarter, Detroit jumped into the lead with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 26-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Lions increased its lead with RB Kevin Jones getting a 4-yard TD run, while Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bears threatened Detroit's lead as QB Brian Griese completed a 20-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen for the only score of the period.  Fortuntaely, in the fourth quarter, the Lions held on to win as Hanson got a 20-yard field goal. Detroit's defense was a huge part of this victory, as they intercepted Griese four times, including three times in the endzone. With their first season-sweep over Chicago since 2004, the Lions improved to 5-2. As a result of their winless 2008 and 2-14 2009 seasons, this became the Lions' last win on the road until Week 15 of the 2010 season. This also remained their most recent win over a division rival until Week 14 of the 2010 season when the Lions beat the Packers.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many interceptions did Griese throw?",
