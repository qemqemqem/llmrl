    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their embarrassing MNF drubbing at the hands of the Saints, the Packers went home for a Week 13 battle with the Carolina Panthers.  In the first quarter, Green Bay trailed early as Panthers RB DeAngelo Williams scored on a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Packers got on the board with kicker Mason Crosby converting a 32-yard field goal, but Carolina answered with QB Jake Delhomme scoring on a 1-yard TD run.  Green Bay responded with QB Aaron Rodgers completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Donald Driver, yet the Panthers closed out the half with Williams rushing for another 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Packers tied the game with Crosby converting a 44-yard field goal, while Rodgers completed a 5-yard TD pass to TE Donald Lee (along with a successful 2-point conversion pass to WR Greg Jennings).  In the fourth quarter, Green Bay took the lead as Rodgers hooked up with Jennings on 21-yard TD pass, yet Carolina replied with Williams scored on yet another 1-yard TD run.  The Packers would regain the lead as Crosby nailed a 19-yard field goal, but the Panthers pulled away as Williams scored on his fourth 1-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Williams score?",
