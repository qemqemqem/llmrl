    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns stayed at home for their Week 5 game against the Atlanta Falcons, and tried to build on their first win of the season. The Falcons scored first, on a 24-yard field goal by kicker Matt Bryant early in the second quarter. The Browns soon answered with a 19-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Seneca Wallace to running back Peyton Hillis. Bryant hit another field goal in the quarter to cut the Cleveland lead to one point. Wallace was injured near halftime, and did not return. In the second half, quarterback Jake Delhomme came out for the Browns, but the offense failed to generate any momentum other than a Phil Dawson field goal. The Falcons took the lead when wide receiver Roddy White caught a 45-yard pass from quarterback Matt Ryan. Cleveland tried to mount a comeback, but an interception return by defensive end Kroy Biermann sealed the win for Atlanta, 20-10.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points in total were scored?",
