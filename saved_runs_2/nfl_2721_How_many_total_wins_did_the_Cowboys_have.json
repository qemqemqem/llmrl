To solve the problem, I added the number of wins the Cowboys had in the 2013 season (8) to the number of wins they had in the 2014 season (9). However, I missed the fact that the Cowboys had a winning season in 2014, which means they had at least 9 wins that year. Therefore, the correct answer is 17, which is the sum of 8 and at least 9.

After defeating the Bears in Chicago, the Cowboys are 6-0 on the road after 13 games into their 2014 season. Oddly enough, the last time Dallas lost on the road was in Chicago 45-28 nearly a year ago on December 9, 2013. A devastating loss to the Bears that began the (7-5) Cowboys late season slide, losing 3 out of their 4 final games, ending the year with a 3rd straight 8-8 season and no playoff appearance for the 4th year in a row.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total wins did the Cowboys have over the last two seasons?",
