In the first quarter, New York trailed early as Bears QB Rex Grossman completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Desmond Clark for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Giants got on the board as RB Derrick Ward got a 2-yard TD run.  Chicago responded with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 35-yard and a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould making a 41-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, New York QB Eli Manning completed a 6-yard TD pass to WR Amani Toomer, along with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 2-yard TD run. New York improved to 8-4 with the victory. Derrick Ward (24 carries for 154 yards and 1 touchdown) left the game in the 4th quarter with a fractured fibula, effectively ending his season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did Chicago score in the first quarter?",
