    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the 49ers, the Seahawks went home, donned their alternate uniforms, and prepared for a Week 3 duel with the Chicago Bears. Due to quarterback Matt Hasselbeck's rib injury, Seneca Wallace got the start for the game. Seattle would take flight in the first quarter with Wallace's 39-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones and kicker Olindo Mare's 46-yard field goal. The Seahawks would tack on Mare's 37-yard field goal in the second quarter, yet the Bears would answer with quarterback Jay Cutler's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Greg Olsen. Chicago would take in the lead in the third quarter with Cutler's 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Johnny Knox, followed by kicker Robbie Gould's 37-yard field goal. The Seahawks would regain the lead in the fourth quarter with Mare's 39-yard and 46-yard field goal. However, the Bears got the last laugh as Cutler hooked up with wide receiver Devin Hester on a 36-yard touchdown pass (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett). Seattle tried to rally, but Chicago's defense held on for the win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Olindo Mare score in the fourth quarter?",
