The correct answer is that the 49ers scored more times than the Lions in the first quarter, with one touchdown. To solve this problem, I carefully read through the passage and identified the scoring plays for each team. I then focused on the first quarter and determined that the 49ers were the only team to score during that time.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn week 2, the Lions flew west to play the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday Night Football. The 49ers got on the board first with a 21-yard touchdown pass from Alex Smith to Vernon Davis. The Lions responded with two field goals by Jason Hanson, from 38 and 41 yards respectively. The only scoring play of the second quarter was a 1-yard touchdown run by Frank Gore. In the third quarter came a pair of field goals, first a 36-yard kick by San Francisco's David Akers, and later a 40-yard one from Detroit's Jason Hanson. In the final quarter, both teams kicked two more field goals both from 48 yards out, first the 49ers' David Akers, then the Lions' Jason Hanson. Next, San Francisco's Vernon Davis caught his second touchdown pass of the game, this one from 23 yards out. Lastly, Detroit scored their only touchdown of the game when Brandon Pettigrew caught a 9-yard pass from Matthew Stafford dropping the team to 1-1.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team scored more times during the first quarter?",

The Lions scored two field goals in the first half of the game, but neither of them were in the first quarter. Therefore, the 49ers scored more times than the Lions in the first quarter.",
