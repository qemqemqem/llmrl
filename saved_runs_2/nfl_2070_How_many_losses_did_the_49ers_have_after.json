In the second quarter the 49ers trailed after RB Cadillac Williams made a 6-yard TD run. This was followed in the third quarter by QB Josh Freeman completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Mike Williams; and in the fourth quarter by Freeman throwing a 1-yard TD pass to Donald Penn. With the loss, the 49ers fell to 3-7.  This marked the 49ers' first shutout loss at home since 1977, when they were defeated by the Atlanta Falcons 7-0.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many losses did the 49ers have after losing to the Buccaneers?",
