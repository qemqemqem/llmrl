    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to halt a six-game losing streak, the Lions returned home to Ford Field for an interconference matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs. Detroit got on the board early with a T.J. Duckett 11-yard TD run and a safety off a blocked Dustin Colquitt punt. In the second quarter, the Lions opened up a 19-0 lead with a Jason Hanson field goal and a Paris Lenon interception return for a touchdown. Kansas City fought back with a Jackie Battle 3-yard run and a 1-yard pass from Damon Huard to Jared Allen to make it 19-14, but the Lions' Jason Hanson added two more field goals in the second half and the Chiefs could not convert a two-point conversion to Tony Gonzalez in the 3rd after a Dwayne Bowe receiving TD. Detroit held Kansas City off 25-20, ending their long skid. With the win, the Lions improved to 7-8, 5-3 at home. Given the Lions' winless 2008 season, this remained the Lions last regular-season victory until the third week of the 2009 season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many games did the Lions win of their last six games?",
