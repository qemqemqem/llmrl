    "problem_text": "Context:\nBy early 1799, the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine. Feldzeugmeister P\u00e1l Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance  to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.\n\nQuestion:\nFeldzeugmeister P\u00e1l Kray led how many men from the Electorate of Bavaria and the Archbishopric of Mainz?",

Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance to protect the Vorarlberg. Therefore, the remaining troops are 120,000 - 25,000 = 95,000 soldiers. The passage also states that Kray's force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and other troops from the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg and the County of Tyrol. Therefore, the total number of men from the Electorate of Bavaria and the Archbishopric of Mainz is 12,000 + 5,000 = 17,000 soldiers.",
