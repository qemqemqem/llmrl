    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I subtracted the year of the transfer of the 126th Motor Rifle Division to the Black Sea Fleet (1989) from the year of the disbandment of the 841st Guards Anti-Submarine Helicopter Regiment (1992), which gave me a time difference of 3 years. This is the correct answer to the problem. \n\nSince the problem was straightforward, there was no need for a more complex strategy. However, if the problem had involved more complex calculations or multiple steps, it would have been helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable parts and use a systematic approach to ensure accuracy.",

Also that year, the 119th Fighter Aviation Division, with the 86th Guards, 161st, and 841st Guards Fighter Aviation Regiments, joined the Fleet from the 5th Air Army.  The 86th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment became part of the Moldovan Air Force upon the breakup of the Soviet Union. The 841st at Meria airport   became the 841st independent Guards Anti-Submarine Helicopter Regiment in May 1991 and was disbanded in October 1992.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after 126th Motor Rifle Division at Simferopol was transferred to the Black Sea Fleet was the 841st independent Guards Anti-Submarine Helicopter Regiment disbanded?",
