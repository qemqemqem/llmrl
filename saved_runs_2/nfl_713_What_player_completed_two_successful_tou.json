In the first quarter, New Orleans trailed early as Panthers kicker John Kasay managed to get a 45-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Saints took the lead with QB Drew Brees completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Lance Moore, along with kicker Olindo Mare kicking a 46-yard field goal.  Carolina ended the half as Kasay nailing a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New Orleans ran away with the game as Brees completed a 1-yard TD pass to WR Billy Miller, got an 8-yard TD run, and completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Marques Colston. For Marques Colston, this marked his fifth-straight game of having at least 65 reception yards in one game.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat player completed two successful touchdown passes during the game?",
