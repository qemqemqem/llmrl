After reviewing the passage again, I found that the smallest number of years that passed between the home run record being broken was one year. In 1951, Gil Hodges became the first member of the Dodgers to hit 40 home runs, breaking Babe Herman's 1930 mark of 35. However, Hodges' record was broken the following year by Roy Campanella, who hit 41 home runs in 1953. To solve the problem better, I should have read the passage more carefully and paid closer attention to the specific home run records being broken.",

He finished 1950 third in the league in both homers (32) and RBI (113), and came in eighth in the MLB Most Valuable Player Award voting. In 1951 he became the first member of the Dodgers to ever hit 40 home runs, breaking Babe Hermans 1930 mark of 35; Campanella hit 41 in 1953, but Hodges recaptured the record with 42 in 1954 before Snider eclipsed him again with 43 in 1956. His last home run of 1951 came on October 2 against the New York Giants (NL), as the Dodgers tied the three-game NL playoff series at a game each with a 10-0 win; New York would take the pennant the next day on Bobby Thomsons \"Shot Heard Round the World (baseball)\". Hodges also led the NL with 126 assists in 1951, and was second in HRs, third in run (baseball) (118) and total bases (307), fifth in slugging average (.527), and sixth in RBI (103).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years was the smallest number that passed between the home run record being broken?",
