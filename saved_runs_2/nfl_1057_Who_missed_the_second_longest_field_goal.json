I reviewed the context again and found that the Colts' kicker Adam Vinatieri attempted a 45-yard field goal in the third quarter, but it was blocked by DT Johnny Jolly. Therefore, the answer to the problem is 45. To solve the problem, I carefully read through the context and identified the relevant information about field goals attempted during the game. To solve it better, I could have created a table to organize the information about the field goals attempted by each team, including the distance and whether they were successful or not. This would have made it easier to identify the answer to the problem.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter snapping their three-game losing streak against the Seattle Seahawks the weekend before, the Packers returned home to face their first AFC opponent of the season, the 2007 AFC South Champion Indianapolis Colts. The game started with the Packers in possession and the Packers started off the game with a nice 14-yard run by RB Ryan Grant for a first down. On the first third down of the drive, Aaron Rodgers completed his first pass of the day to TE Donald Lee for an 11-yard gain. Colts CB Marlin Jackson was flagged for unnecessary roughness after the play and the Colts were penalized 15&#160;yards for the Packers 49 down to the Colts 36-yard line. After a 1-yard run and an incomplete pass on 1st and second downs, Rodgers completed a 6-yard pass to TE Donald Lee on 3rd and 9 but was nullified when Colts CB Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive holding on WR Greg Jennings during the play resulting in a 5-yard penalty and a 1st down. The next play was a run by RB Ryan Grant for 4&#160;yards. Grant fumbled the ball on the play and it looked to be recovered by the Colts, but the ball slipped past the defenders and FB Korey Hall dove onto the ball and recovered the fumble for the Packers. Grant then followed up the play with a 5-yard gain on 2nd down and a surprise hand off to FB John Kuhn on 3rd down and 1 for 3&#160;yards secured another 1st down for the Packers at the Colts 18-yard line. The drive ended with an incomplete pass the WR Ruvell Martin on 3rd down and the Packers were forced to settle for a Mason Crosby 31-yard field goal to take the early 3-0 lead. After the field goal, The Packers attempted to onside kick but the ball went out of bounds after 15&#160;yards. On the retry, Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds again but this time it was much farther down field. The ball was then placed at the Colts 45-yard line but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved the ball back to the Colts 30-yard line. On the Colts first drive, they seemed to be able to move the ball very well with runs by the injured starter  Joseph Addai's replacement Dominic Rhodes paired with a 9-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on CB Tramon Williams on 3rd and 1 at the Colts 39, QB Peyton Manning connected with WR Reggie Wayne for a 15-yard gain on the next 3rd down to the GB 16-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed the ball four consecutive times and capped the drive with a 3-yard rush for the touchdown. The Colts took the 7-3 lead with 4:06 left in the 1st. The Packers second drive of the game started with an Aaron Rodgers pass left to Greg Jennings for 14&#160;yards under soft coverage. Ryan Grant continued rushing the ball better with a nice 7-yard gain on the next play to the Green Bay 41-yard line. Rodgers failed to connect on a pass deep to Greg Jennings on the next play but CB Tim Jennings was flagged for pass interference resulting in a 25-yard penalty down to the Colts 34-yard line. After a couple of short runs by Ryan Grant, Rodgers completed a 7-yard pass to Greg Jennings on 3rd and 6 for the first down. After a Colts neutral zone infraction penalty and a couple more short rush attempts by Ryan Grant, The Packers first touchdown of the game was scored on a 12-yard pass to TE Donald Lee. With a little more than 14&#160;minutes left in the 2nd quarter, the Packers took the 10-7 lead. The Colts continued to attempt to move the ball on their next drive with runs and short passes to the running backs and tight ends but their drive stalled near midfield when Peyton Manning completed a pass to WR Marvin Harrison a-yard short of the first down. It appeared that the Colts were going to keep their offense on the field and go for it on fourth down and 1 but Colts coach Tony Dungy thought otherwise and Peyton Manning left the field with a look of disagreement with his coaches decision. After the punt the Packers offense started their third drive of the day at the Green Bay 11. The Packers quickly got out of the shadows of the goal post with a 24-yard pass to WR Donald Driver to the 35-yard line. After a short 3-yard gain by Ryan Grant and two 3-yard receptions by Donald Driver, the Packers were faced with a 4 and 1 at their own 44-yard line much like the Colts on their previous drive. Instead of punting like the Colts did, the Packers kept their offense on the field a managed to get the first down on a nice 7-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 33-yard line with a few short runs by Ryan Grant mixed with a short pass to RB Brandon Jackson for 9&#160;yards. On 2nd a 7 Rodgers dropped back to pass and looked to throw to WR Greg Jennings but decided to dump the ball off the Brandon Jackson for the second time on the drive but he was tackled for a 1-yard loss. During the play a flag was thrown for illegal use of the hands on CB Tim Jennings who was coving Greg Jennings on the play. After a rush for no gain on 1st down at the Colts 28, Rodgers connected with WR Ruvell Martin for 17&#160;yards to the Colts 11-yard line. The Packers scored their second touchdown of the day on the next play with an 11-yard rush by Ryan Grant. The Packers now held a 17-7 lead with 2:53 left in the half. Now in a ten-point hole, The Colts offense took the field again but could not manage to get a first down. DT Ryan Pickett batted down the pass intended for Marvin Harrison on 3rd down and forced the Colts to punt. With 1:54 remaining in the half the Packers started their final drive of the half on their own 33-yard line. The drive featured many short passes to RB Brandon Jackson for decent gains along with a Rodgers scramble down the middle of the field for a 9-yard gain. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 18-yard line and took a time out with 9&#160;seconds left. Mason Crosby attempted a 36-yard field goal but the kick was pushed wide left. The half ended with Peyton Manning taking a knee and the Packers went in the half with a 17-7 lead. The Colts started the second half with possession and managed to move the ball to the Packers 48-yard line, but a pass to Reggie Wayne on 3rd and 6 went through his hands and popped up into the air. FS Nick Collins who was a couple yards behind Wayne was in perfect position to intercept the ball and returned it 62&#160;yards for the touchdown to take the commanding 24-7 lead early in the 3rd. After the interception return the Colts offense took the field and managed to move the ball down to the Packers 28-yard line with a 29-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 1-yard rush and two incomplete passes the Colt's Adam Vinatieri attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT Johnny Jolly. The Packers took over possession but failed to move the ball and was forced to punt. During the punt, Colts Tim Jennings was flagged for defensive delay of game and the Packers were awarded 5&#160;yards and a 1st down. The Packers then managed to move the ball down to the Colts 11 with some short gains on the ground by Ryan Grant. The highlight of the drive took place when FB Korey Hall received a pass from Aaron Rodgers and hurdled over the oncoming defender. The drive ended when Ryan Grant couldn't get past the 1st down marker on 3rd down and they had to settle for a successful 29-yard field goal by Mason Crosby to extend the lead to 27-7. The Colts managed to get a first down off an illegal contact penalty on 3rd down, but the drive ended with three incomplete passes by Peyton Manning. The Colts punted and the Packers ended the 3rd quarter with 2 rushes by Ryan Grant. The first play of the 4th was an incomplete pass to TE Tory Humphrey and the Packers were forced to punt for the first time of the contest. The Colts again couldn't move the ball on their next possession and were forced to punt, The Packers took over and gain one first down on a pass to Brandon Jackson, but they failed to break into Colts territory and punted for the second time of the contest. With time not on the Colts side, the Colts drove down all the way to the Packers 5-yard line and were looking to score. Manning forced a throw into triple coverage in the end zone to Dallas Clark earlier in the drive and it was almost intercepted by Charles Woodson but S Aaron Rouse batted the ball down before Woodson could secure the pick. Rouse made up for it though 3 plays later when he stepped in front of WR Anthony Gonzalez at the 1-yard line and intercepted the pass. Rouse returned the ball 99&#160;yards for the Packers second interception for a touchdown in the game and 5th of the season. With the score the Packers increased their lead to 34-7 with about 4:30 remaining in the game. In a prevent style defense, the Packers allowed the Colts offense to move down the field to the Green Bay 15. Peyton Manning threw the ball to Anthony Gonzalez at the goal line and he looked to be in for the score. The booth reviewed the catch and the call on the field was reversed. On the next play, Manning completed another pass to Dallas Clark and he dove for the pylon for the score. The booth reviewed the touchdown and again the touchdown wasn't awarded but the ball was placed at the 1-yard line. RB Dominic Rhodes rushed 1-yard for the touchdown to decrease the Packers lead to 34-14. The Colts lined up in an onside kick formation but kicker Adam Vinatieri instead kicked the ball shallow and it was easily caught by Charles Woodson. Ryan Grant rushed for 9&#160;yards on 1st down to put him over the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and two Aaron Rodgers kneel downs sealed the dominating victory. With the win, the Green Bay Packers improved their record to 4-3 going into the bye week.\n\nQuestion:\nWho missed the second longest field goal?",
