    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Bears the Redskins flew to Ford Field for an NFC duel with the Lions. In the 2nd quarter the Redskins trailed early as QB Matthew Stafford got a 13-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. They pulled ahead with QB Donovan McNabb getting a 6-yard TD pass to RB Ryan Torain, followed by kicker Graham Gano making a 38 and a 46-yard field goal. The Redskins trailed slightly with Stafford getting a 2-yard TD pass to TE Brandon Pettigrew. The Redskins got the lead back with RB Keiland Williams getting a 5-yard TD run (With a failed 2-point conversion). The Lions replied with Stafford finding Johnson again on a 7-yard TD pass (With a failed 2-point conversion). After that, the Redskins took the lead again with WR Brandon Banks returning a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown (With a failed 2-point conversion) to put the Redskins up 25-20. They soon fell behind with Stafford throwing a 10-yard TD pass to Johnson (With a successful 2-point conversion as Stafford passed to WR Bryant Johnson). This was followed by kicker Jason Hanson making a 32-yard field goal, and with DT Ndamukong Suh returning a fumble 17 yards to the endzone for a touchdown (With a failed 2-point conversion). With the loss, the Redskins went into their bye week at 4-4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many games had the Redskins played after the game?",
