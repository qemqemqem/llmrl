To find the difference between Janikowski's longest and shortest field goals, I should have subtracted the distance of his shortest field goal from the distance of his longest field goal, which would be 28 - 10 = 18 yards. In the future, I will make sure to read the problem more carefully and double-check my calculations to avoid making similar mistakes.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to avenge their Week 3 loss at Buffalo, the Patriots flew across the country to face the Oakland Raiders. The Raiders grabbed the lead in the first quarter, with a 28-yard field goal by placekicker Sebastian Janikowski. The Patriots responded, with quarterback Tom Brady throwing a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. The Raiders re-claimed the lead in the second quarter, with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Michael Bush. The Patriots answered, with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis, followed by a 44-yard field goal by placekicker Stephen Gostkowski just before halftime. The Patriots added to their lead in the third quarter, with a 33-yard TD-run by running back Stevan Ridley. The Raiders narrowed the lead, with a 26-yard field goal by Janikowski, but the Patriots increased it in the fourth quarter, with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Brady to wide receiver Deion Branch. The Raiders scored a late touchdown, with quarterback Jason Campbell throwing a 6-yard pass to wide receiver Denarius Moore (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), but the Patriots ran out the clock, sealing the win. With the win, the Patriots improved to 3-1; it was also the franchise's 200th win (regular season and playoff) under Robert Kraft's ownership.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more yards long was Janikowski's longest field goal than his shortest?",
