    "problem_text": "Context:\nDuring the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87\u201385. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113\u201391 and evening the series up at 1\u20131. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104\u2013103. Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. Manu Gin\u00f3bili, who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did San Antonio win by in the 2006 playoffs?",
