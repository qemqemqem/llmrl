To solve the problem, I needed to identify the players who scored touchdowns in the game and determine the length of each touchdown pass. After analyzing the given information, I found that David Garrard had two touchdown passes longer than 5 yards, one to TE Marcedes Lewis on a 42-yard TD pass and the other to WR Mike Thomas on a 15-yard TD pass. Therefore, the correct answer is two players had touchdown passes longer than 5 yards.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have created a table to organize the information and make it easier to identify the players who scored touchdowns and the length of each touchdown pass.

In the first quarter the Cowboys took the lead as kicker David Buehler hit a 34-yard field goal. But they fell behind with QB David Garrard getting a 10-yard TD pass to WR Mike Sims-Walker. In the second quarter, the Cowboys struggled further with Garrard finding TE Marcedes Lewis on a 42-yard TD pass, then in the third quarter he found WR Mike Thomas on a 15-yard TD pass, and then he found Lewis again on a 9-yard TD pass. The Cowboys responded in the 4th quarter with RB Marion Barber getting a 1-yard TD run. But the Jaguars scored again with Garrard scrambling 2 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The Cowboys replied with QB Jon Kitna making an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich players had touchdown passes longer than 5 yards?",
