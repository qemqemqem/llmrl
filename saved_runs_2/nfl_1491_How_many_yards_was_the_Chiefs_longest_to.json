Kansas City would find themselves trailing in the first quarter as Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Malcom Floyd, followed by a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Vincent Jackson. San Diego would add onto their lead in the second quarter with a 20-yard and a 39-yard field goal from kicker Nate Kaeding. The Chiefs would get onto the board in the third quarter with quarterback Matt Cassel completing a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Dwayne Bowe, but the Chargers kept their momentum going with Rivers finding running back Darren Sproles on a 58-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter, San Diego sealed the win with Kaeding's 19-yard field goal and fullback Jacob Hester recovering a blocked punt in the end zone for a touchdown. With the loss, Kansas City went into their bye week at 1-6. Larry Johnson was suspended for two weeks after he made offensive comments about Todd Haley and made offensive comments about homosexuals on Twitter and in public.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the Chiefs longest touchdown?",
