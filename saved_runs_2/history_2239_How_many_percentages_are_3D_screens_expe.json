    "problem_text": "Context:\nBy June 2010, there were close to 16,000 digital cinema screens, with over 5000 of them being stereoscopic setups. David Hancock claims that the total number of digital screens worldwide was 36,242, up from 16,339 at end 2009 or a growth rate of 121.8 percent during the year. There were 10,083 d-screens in Europe as a whole (28.2 percent of global figure), 16,522 in the United States and Canada (46.2 percent of global figure) and 7,703 in Asia (21.6 percent of global figure). As regards digital 3D screens, there were a total of 21,936 3D screens, which equals 60.5 percent of all d-screens. This was a rise from the 55 percent in 2009 but is expected to drop slightly in 2011 to 57.5 percent. By the end of 2012, according to Screen Digest, 91.4% of UK screens had been converted to digital and the rest expected to be so by the middle of 2013. Worldwide progress was slower as in some territories, particularly Latin America and Africa. However almost all screens worldwide were expected to be converted by the end of 2015. As of 31 March 2015, 38,719 screens (out of a total of 39,789 screens) in the United States have been converted to digital (15,643 of which are 3D capable), 3,007 screens in Canada have been converted (1,382 of which are 3D), and 93,147 screens internationally have been converted (59,350 of which are 3D). As of 3 May 2016, 98.2% of the worlds cinema screens were digitized.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percentages are 3D screens expected to drop between 2009 and 2011?",
