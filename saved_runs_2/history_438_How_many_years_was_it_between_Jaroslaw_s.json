    "problem_text": "Context:\nUpon his appointment as Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw in 1198, Jaros\u0142aw of Opole, elder son of the Silesian duke Boles\u0142aw I the Tall, received the territories around the town of Nysa  from his father. After Jaros\u0142aw's death in 1201, his half-brother Duke Henry I the Bearded of Silesia decided to leave Nysa, as well as the castellany of Otmuch\u00f3w, under the control of the Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw, while the rest of the late Jaros\u0142aw's Upper Silesian lands were annexed by his uncle Mieszko IV Tanglefoot in the following year. In 1290 Henry IV Probus, duke of Lower Silesia at Wroc\u0142aw, gave the bishops privileges of autonomy on their lands in Nysa, creating the legal basis for the Duchy of Nysa. Henry of Wierzbna, Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw from 1302 to 1319, was the first to actually use the title of a Duke of Nysa. The duchy in its original form only lasted until 1335, when Silesia passed to the Kingdom of Bohemia by the Treaty of Trentschin. In 1342 Bishop Przec\u0142aw of Pogorzeli swore the oath of fealty to King John the Blind and afterwards played a vital role in the negotiations for the 1348 Treaty of Namslau between John's successor Charles IV and King Casimir III the Great of Poland. Pogorzeli also significantly enlarged his territory by acquisition of Grodk\u00f3w  from Duke Boles\u0142aw III the Generous of Brzeg in 1344. For the next two hundred years, the Polish, Czech and German inhabitants of Nysa-Grodk\u00f3w lived in relative harmony, even during the beginnings of the Reformation as the control of the region switched between Protestant and Catholic rulers. This ended with the Thirty Years' War.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years was it between Jaroslaw's death and the Treaty of Namslau?",
