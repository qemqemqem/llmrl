    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game skid, the Bills flew to Gillette Stadium for a Week 3 divisional fight with the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, QB J. P. Losman was immediately injured on the first offensive play of the game.  He would finish the series, but ended up on the bench for the rest of the game.  After New England took the lead with kicker Stephen Gostkowski's 24-yard field goal, rookie QB Trent Edwards played the rest of the game for Buffalo.  The Bills would get their only score of the game as RB Marshawn Lynch got an 8-yard TD run, and a Rian Lindell extra point put the Bills ahead surprisingly 7-3.  However, in the second quarter, the Patriots were able to open up their running game when Bills rookie standout Paul Posluszny was lost due to a broken arm. This left passing lanes open, and for the rest of the game, the Patriots dominated. QB Tom Brady's 8-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson and a 3-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss made it 17-7 at the half.  In the third quarter, New England continued its conquest with Brady's 4-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney and RB Sammy Morris' 4-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots ended the day with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 45-yard TD pass.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more touchdowns did the Patriots score than the Bills?",
