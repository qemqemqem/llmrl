Miami delivered the game's opening splash with a 9-yard touchdown run from quarterback Chad Henne.  The Patriots answered with running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis getting a 4-yard touchdown run.  New England took the lead in the second quarter as quarterback Tom Brady completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski. The Dolphins struck back in the third quarter as Henne found wide receiver Brian Hartline on a 10-yard touchdown pass, but New England came right back with Brady completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker.  Miami replied with a 20-yard field goal from kicker Dan Carpenter, but the Patriots came right back with Brady completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Aaron Hernandez.  New England added onto their in the fourth quarter as kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 20-yard field goal, followed by Brady completing a 99-yard touchdown pass to Welker.  The Dolphins would close out the game with Henne finding running back Reggie Bush on a 2-yard touchdown pass.\n\nQuestion:\nFrom what yard lines were touchdowns scored in the first two quarters?",
