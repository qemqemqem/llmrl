In the first quarter the Rams took the lead after QB Sam Bradford making a 25-yard TD pass to TE Michael Hoomanawanui. The Falcons replied with kicker Matt Bryant hitting a 42-yard field goal. The Rams increased their lead when kicker Josh Brown hit a 53-yard field goal. The lead didn't last long after QB Matt Ryan completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Brian Finneran, followed by Bryant nailing a 29 and a 24-yard field goal. The Rams tried to cut the lead with Bradford making a 13-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Gibson, but they struggled further as Ryan threw a 2-yard TD pass to TE Justin Peelle. This was followed in the fourth quarter by Bryant nailing a 21-yard field goal, and with RB Michael Turner getting a 39-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team does Michael Turner play on?",
