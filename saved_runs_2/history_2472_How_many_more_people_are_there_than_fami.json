I misunderstood the problem and subtracted the number of families in 2000 from the number of people in 2010, instead of subtracting the number of households in 2000 from the number of people in 2010. To solve the problem correctly, we need to subtract the number of households from the number of people in 2010. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1,306,300 (number of people in 2010) - 354,215 (number of households in 2000) = 952,085\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully and paid closer attention to the specific numbers given.",
