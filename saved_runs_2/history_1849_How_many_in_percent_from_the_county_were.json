To solve the problem, I first added the percentage of the population that was under 18 (23.70%) and the percentage that was 25 or older (48.80%). Then, I subtracted this sum from 100 to find the percentage of the population that was not between the ages of 18 and 24. This gave me a result of 27.50%. However, this is not the correct answer. To solve the problem correctly, I should have subtracted the percentage of the population that was between the ages of 18 and 24 (15.50%) from 100. This gives a result of 84.50%, which is the correct answer. In the future, I will make sure to read the problem more carefully and double-check my calculations to avoid making mistakes.",
