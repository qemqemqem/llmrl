Pittsburgh delivered the opening strike in the first quarter as running back Rashard Mendenhall got a 1-yard touchdown run, followed by a 25-yard field goal from kicker Jeff Reed.  The Bengals answered in the second quarter as quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens, yet the Steelers responded with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger hooking up with wide receiver Hines Ward on an 8-yard touchdown pass, followed by Reed's 53-yard field goal.  After a scoreless third quarter, Pittsburgh added onto their lead in the fourth quarter as wide receiver Antwaan Randle El found wide receiver Mike Wallace on a 39-yard touchdown pass.  Cincinnati tried to rally as Palmer completed a 27-yard touchdown pass to Owens, followed by running back Cedric Benson getting a 1-yard touchdown run, thanks in no small part to two consecutive penalties called against the Steelers, both of which were later deemed by the NFL to have been incorrect.  Fortunately, the defense held on to preserve the victory.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat were later deemed by the NFL to have been incorrect?",
