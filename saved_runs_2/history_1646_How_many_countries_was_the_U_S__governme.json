    "commentary_on_process": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. To solve the problem, I carefully read the information provided and identified that the U.S. government was spending $9.4 million per day in operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Since there was no information provided about spending in other countries, it can be concluded that the U.S. government was not spending more than $9 million per day in any other countries. However, upon further review, I realized that the question was asking for the number of countries where the U.S. government was spending more than $9 million per day, not the total amount spent. Therefore, the correct answer is 2, since the U.S. government was spending more than $9 million per day in both Syria and Iraq. To solve the problem better, I should have read the question more carefully and paid closer attention to the wording.",

According to the Costs of War Project at Brown University's Watson Institute, the War on Terror will have cost $5.6 trillion for operations between 2001-2018 plus anticipated future costs of veterans' care. According to the Soufan Group in July 2015, the U.S. government was spending $9.4 million per day in operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. A March 2011 Congressional report estimated war spending through the fiscal year 2011 at $1.2 trillion, and future spending through 2021  at $1.8 trillion. A June 2011 academic report covering additional areas of war spending estimated it through 2011 at $2.7 trillion, and long-term spending at $5.4 trillion including interest.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many countries was the U.S. government spending more than 9 million dollars on per day?",
