On the game's most bizarre play, the ball was stripped from RB Jonathan Stewart by a Tampa defender; the ball flew up in the air and TE Ed Dickson, who'd been trailing the play, grabbed it and ran untouched into the end zone. With the victory, the Panthers improved to 4-0. Carolina also became one of five teams to finish the first quarter of the season undefeated overall, and one of three NFC teams to do so.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many NFC teams besides Carolina finished the first quarter of the season undefeated overall?",
