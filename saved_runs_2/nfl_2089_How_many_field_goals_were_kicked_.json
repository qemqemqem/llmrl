    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the 49ers the Seahawks played on home ground for an NFC duel with the Falcons. In the first quarter the Seahawks took the lead with RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run, with the Falcons replying with QB Matt Ryan making a 3-yard TD pass to FB Jason Snelling. The Seahawks trailed slightly with kicker Matt Bryant hitting a 27-yard field goal, but managed to tie the game with kicker Olindo Mare nailing a 38-yard field goal. They struggled to keep up after Ryan completed a 24-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins, followed by QB Matt Hasselbeck losing the ball in the endzone which was picked up by DT Jonathan Babineaux for a touchdown. This was followed by Bryant getting a 25-yard field goal, and then with Ryan getting a 5-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. The Seahawks tried to cut the lead, but only came away with QB Charlie Whitehurst scrambling a yard for a touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were kicked?",
