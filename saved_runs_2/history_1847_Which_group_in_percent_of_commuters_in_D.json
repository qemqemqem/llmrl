To solve the problem, I looked at the modal share percentages for carpooling and cycling in Dallas in 2009 and compared them. The percentage for cycling was 0.1%, while the percentage for carpooling was 10.7%. Therefore, the answer is carpooling. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have double-checked my calculations to ensure accuracy.

The 2009 modal share for Dallas (city) commuters are 10.7% for carpooling, 3.9% for transit, 1.9% for walking, and .1% for cycling. In 2015, the American Community Survey estimated modal shares for Dallas (city) commuters of 75.4% for driving alone, 12.8% for carpooling, 3.5% for riding transit, 1.9% for walking, and .2% for cycling. The city of Dallas has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 10.2 percent of Dallas households lacked a car, and decreased to 9.1 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Dallas averaged 1.59 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich group in percent of commuters in Dallas in 2009 is smaller: carpooling or cycling?",
