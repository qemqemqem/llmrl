I misunderstood the question and subtracted the number of households from the number of housing units instead of the other way around. To solve the problem correctly, I should have subtracted the number of housing units from the number of households to find the number of families, which is 5,205 - 7,362 = -2,157. However, this result does not make sense, as the number of families cannot be negative. Therefore, I believe there may be an error in the given information or in the question itself.

The population density was 20 people per square mile (8/km\u00b2).  There were 7,362 housing units at an average density of 10 per square mile (4/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the county was 88.80% Race (United States Census), 8.98% Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census), 0.46% Race (United States Census), 0.25% Race (United States Census), 0.03% Race (United States Census), 0.45% from Race (United States Census), and 1.03% from two or more races. 1.80% of the population were Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census) of any race.  In terms of ancestry, 39.7% were English people, 15.2% were Irish people, 14.7% were Americans, and 5.2% were Germans.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many housing units are there than families?",

To find the difference between the number of housing units and the number of families, we need to find the number of families. The number of families is not given directly, but we know that there were an estimated 5,205 households in 2000, so we can assume that there were roughly the same number of families. Therefore, the number of housing units (7,362) minus the number of families (5,205) is 2,157.",
