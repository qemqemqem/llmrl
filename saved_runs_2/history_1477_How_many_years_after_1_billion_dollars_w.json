    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn May 2009, SAC reported that 1 billion was missing from Oil Stabilization Fund. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says the issue of the 'missing' $1 billion from the country's currency reserve fund is in fact an \"accounting error.\" However, the claim prompted a firm response from SAC which rejected any talks of \"accounting errors\" and rebuked the government for providing \"insufficient answers\" in the case of the missing $1.058 billion oil money. SAC defended both methodology and accuracy of its work and revealed that there had been 1463 cases of infractions regarding the country's 2007-2008 budget. According to SAC's report, illegal payments to some government officials accounted for a large part of the infractions while there were also cases in which the government had acted against the articles of the budget law. In December 2010, Supreme Audit Court  Director Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said that the case was mentioned in a report presented to the Majlis and the report neither called it fraud nor said the money was missing, but only referred to it as \"a deficit in the account\".\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after 1 billion dollars was reported missing was it refereed to as \"a deficit in the account\"?",
