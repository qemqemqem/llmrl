    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their first win of the year against the Saints, the Rams flew to Bill Walsh Field at Monster Park for a Week 11 NFC West rematch with the throwback-clad San Francisco 49ers.  In the first quarter, St. Louis drew first blood as QB Marc Bulger completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt.  The 49ers responded with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 28-yard TD field goal.  In the second quarter, the Rams increased their lead with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 49-yard field goal for the only score of the period. After a scoreless third quarter, St. Louis continued its domination as Wilkins kicked a 35-yard field goal.  San Francisco tried to come back as Nedney nailed a 38-yard and a 46-yard field goal, yet St. Louis managed to hold a late drive to seal the victory. With the win, not only did the Rams improve to 2-8, but they also became the sixth NFL franchise to reach 500 overall wins. WR Isaac Bruce ended this game with 13,795 career receiving yards (6th All-Time).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Wilkins kick?",
