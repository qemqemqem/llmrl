The Lions took an early lead midway through the first quarter with a 14-yard TD catch by Nate Burleson. The Giants responded at the end of the 1st quarter with a 4-yard TD run by Brandon Jacobs. In the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead with a 33-yard TD catch by Mario Manningham. The Lions responded with a 50-yard field goal just before halftime. Shaun Hill was also injured before halftime and left the game with a broken left forearm. Drew Stanton took over the QB role for the remainder of the game. The only score of the 3rd quarter was a 1-yard TD catch by Travis Beckum of the Giants. The Lions attempted a comeback when Calvin Johnson caught an 87-yard TD. The Giants responded with a 6-yard TD catch by Brandon Jacobs. The Lions ended the scoring with another 50-yard field goal.  With the loss, not only did the Lions fall to 1-5 into their bye week, but it increased their road losing streak to 24, tying the NFL record that the team set from 2001-2003.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the longest touchdown catch of the game?",
