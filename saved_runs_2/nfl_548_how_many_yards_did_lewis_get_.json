    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Cardinals, the Browns flew to The Meadowlands for a Week 14 intraconference duel with the New York Jets. After a scoreless first quarter, Cleveland drew first blood in the second quarter as QB Derek Anderson completed a 7-yard TD pass to RB Jamal Lewis. The Jets would reply with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Browns continued their recent success with Anderson completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. New York would answer with Nugent kicking a 41-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland increased its lead with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 49-yard field goal. The Jets tried to come back as QB Kellen Clemens managed to get a 1-yard TD run, while Nugent kicked a 38-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cleveland pulled away as Lewis got a 31-yard TD run. New York would end the game with Nugent nailing a 35-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did lewis get?",
