He joined the Society of Jesus in 1617 at the age of 24, spending the next two years under the direction of Lancelot Marin. Between 1619 and 1621, he was a teacher at the college of Rouen. Br\u00e9beuf was nearly expelled from the Society when he contracted tuberculosis in 1620\u2014a severe and usually fatal illness that prevented his studying and teaching for the traditional periods. His record as a student was not particularly distinguished, but Br\u00e9beuf was already beginning to show an aptitude for languages. Later in New France, he would teach Native American languages to missionaries and French traders. Br\u00e9beuf was ordained as a priest at Pontoise in February 1622.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat event happened later, Brebeuf being ordained as a priest or Brebeuf jioning the society of Jesus?",
