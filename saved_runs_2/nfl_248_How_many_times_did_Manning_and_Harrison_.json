    "problem_text": "Context:\nRiding high from their Monday Night win over the Vikings, the Patriots returned home for a highly anticipated Sunday Night matchup with the Indianapolis Colts. In the first quarter, the Colts drew first blood as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Dillon helped the Patriots respond with a one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would re-take the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Joseph Addai. Dillon again tied the game, this time on a four-yard touchdown run. Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri then nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Colts a lead they would not relinquish. In the third quarter, the duo of Manning and Harrison struck again with a four-yard touchdown strike. The Patriots responded with a 49-yard field goal, Gostkowski's career longest to date. In the fourth quarter, Vinatieri kicked a 31-yard field goal to make the score 27-17. On the Patriots next possession they drove down the field but ended up going 3-and-out in the red zone and settled for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the Colts' ensuing drive, a drive set up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6-2. As part of his 5-catch effort in the game, Troy Brown became the Patriots' all-time leader in receptions. (Stanley Morgan, 534) This would be the last time Brady lost at home to a team from another AFC division during the regular season until Week 1 of the 2017 season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many times did Manning and Harrison work together to score?",
