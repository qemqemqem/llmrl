The Ravens took the lead after QB Joe Flacco completed a 32-yard TD pass to RB Willis McGahee. The Dolphins replied with RB Ronnie Brown getting a 12-yard TD run. The Ravens got the lead back after kicker Billy Cundiff made a 26 and a 39-yard field goal. The Dolphins narrowed the lead with kicker Dan Carpenter nailing a 19-yard field goal.
