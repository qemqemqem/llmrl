The Titans trailed early in the 2nd quarter as QB Kyle Orton got a 2-yard TD pass to WR Eddie Royal. They replied with QB Vince Young getting an 8-yard TD pass to WR Kenny Britt. The Broncos' kicker Matt Prater made a 36-yard field goal to give Denver a 3-point lead, but the Titans replied when kicker Rob Bironas nailed an incredible 55-yard field goal. In the 3rd quarter the Titans trailed slightly when Matt Prater made a 36-yard field goal, but after that, WR Marc Mariani returned the kickoff and ran 98&#160;yards to the endzone for a touchdown, giving the Titans the lead. The lead was narrowed when Prater made a 35-yard field goal, but was increased again when Bironas made a 46-yard field goal. In the 4th quarter Tennessee fell behind when QB Kyle Orton completed a 6-yard TD pass to RB Correll Buckhalter, followed by Prater making another 36-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich players scored field goals shorter than 55 yards?",
