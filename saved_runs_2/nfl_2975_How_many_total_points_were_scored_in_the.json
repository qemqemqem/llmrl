    "problem_text": "Context:\nThis game was notorious for a terrible playcall made by Colts' coach, Chuck Pagano.  With the Colts trailing 27-21 late in the 3rd quarter, Pagano opted to go for it using special teams on 4th and 3 on the Colts' 37 yard line.  However, a bizarre formation resulted in a Patriots sack, Colts turnover, and a flag for illegal formation.  The Patriots easily scored a touchdown on the next drive and went on to win the game by 7 points, 34-27.  The playcall was universally criticized and was considered by many to be the worst play in NFL history.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total points were scored in the game?",
