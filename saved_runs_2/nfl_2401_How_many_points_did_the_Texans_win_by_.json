    "problem_text": "Context:\n(2012 New York Jets season)Many expected the Texans to roll through the seemingly dismal Jets team in their first primetime appearance of the season.  Even though the Texans never trailed in the game, the Jets kept pace throughout, thanks in large part to a 100-yard kickoff return touchdown by the Jets' Joe McKnight.  The Texans were able to keep the Jets at bay just enough to earn a hard fought win on the road, and improve to 5-0, remaining one of only two teams undefeated in the NFL to this point along with the Atlanta Falcons.  This was also the first time the Texans have ever defeated the New York Jets in their 11-year history, making them 1-5 against the Jets overall and improving their regular season record to 5-0. On the opening drive Houston scored to take a 7-0 lead. Houston got the ball but was intercepted at their own 35. Mark Sanchez threw a touchdown to Josh Cumberland to make it 7-7. In the second, Arian Foster scored to make it 14-7. A Shayne Graham field goal made it 17-7 at the half. Houston would kick another field goal to make it 20-7. The ensuing kickoff was returned by Joe McKnight 100 yards to make it 20-14. Another Houston field goal made it 23-14. The Jets would get a field goal before the game ended to end it 23-17 Houston. The Texans improved to 5-0.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Texans win by?",
