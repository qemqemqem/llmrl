    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Titans, the Vikings flew to the Louisiana Superdome for a Week 5 Monday Night duel with the New Orleans Saints. In the game, QB Gus Frerotte was making his first MNF start since 1997 (when he was with the Washington Redskins). In the first quarter, the Vikes trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. Minnesota would respond with CB Antoine Winfield returning a blocked field goal 59&#160;yards for a touchdown, the first (and longest) ever in franchise history. New Orleans would answer with kicker Mart&#237;n Gram&#225;tica getting a 35-yard field goal, yet the Vikings replied with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 53-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Vikes took the lead on a trick play as RB Chester Taylor completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe, along with Longwell kicking a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Saints began to rally as RB Reggie Bush returned a punt 71&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans took the lead with Gram&#225;tica's 53-yard field goal and Bush's 64-yard punt return for a touchdown. Afterwards, Minnesota answered with Frerotte completing a 33-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian, along with Longwell nailing the game-winning 30-yard field goal. Antoine Winfield had a big game. In addition to his touchdown off of a blocked field goal, he had 8 tackles and a sack (with a forced fumble recovery). This was also the first time in NFL history that a game had a combination of a blocked field goal, a TD pass by a non-quarterback, two field goals of 50+ yards, and two punts returned for touchdowns.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player scored the longest touchdown of the second quarter?",
