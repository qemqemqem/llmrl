    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I used the information given in the context that the sex-ratio of Kumbakonam is 1,021 females for every 1,000 males. This means that for every 1,000 males, there are 1,021 females. To find the difference between the number of females and males, I subtracted 1,000 from 1,021, which gave me 21. Therefore, there were 21 more females per 100 than males in Kumbakonam.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have used the formula for sex-ratio, which is (number of females / number of males) x 1,000. This would have given me the sex-ratio directly, which is 1,021 in this case. Then, I could have subtracted 1,000 from the sex-ratio to get the difference between the number of females and males, which is 21.",
