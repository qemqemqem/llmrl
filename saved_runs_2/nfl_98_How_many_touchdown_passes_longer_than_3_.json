From the get-go, things immediately got ugly, as RB Reuben Droughns fumbled and LB Sam Williams picked up the ball for a 30-yard return touchdown.  In the second quarter, the Browns' woes continued, as QB Andrew Walter completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss.  Cleveland would get a 28-yard field goal by kicker Phil Dawson, but Oakland continued to pour on the hurt as RB LaMont Jordan ran 59 yards for a touchdown.  The Browns would get a touchdown before halftime, as QB Charlie Frye completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Darnell Dinkins.  In the third quarter, Cleveland finally managed to click on all cylinders, as Frye completed two more TD passes to TE Kellen Winslow (a 2-yard pass) and WR Joe Jurevicius (a 5-yard pass) to take the lead.  Afterward, the Browns held on for the rest of the game to finally get their first win of the year causing them to improve to 1-3.  1-2 in conference games.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes longer than 3 yards did Charlie Frye throw?",
