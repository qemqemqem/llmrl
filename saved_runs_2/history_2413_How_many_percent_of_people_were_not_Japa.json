Blacks or African Americans made up 25% of Houstons population, Native Americans in the United States made up 0.7% of the population,  Asians made up 6% (1.7% Vietnamese Americans, 1.3% Chinese Americans, 1.3% Indian Americans, 0.9% Pakistani Americans, 0.4% Filipino Americans, 0.3% Korean Americans, 0.1% Japanese Americans) and Pacific Islanders made up 0.1%. Individuals from some other race made up 15.2% of the citys population, of which 0.2% were non-Hispanic.
