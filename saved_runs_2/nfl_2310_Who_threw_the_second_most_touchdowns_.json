To solve the problem, I read through the given information and counted the number of touchdowns thrown by each quarterback. Ben Roethlisberger threw 5 touchdowns, so he threw the most. However, the question asked for the quarterback who threw the second most touchdowns, which was not explicitly stated in the given information. Upon reviewing the information again, I see that Roethlisberger threw all of the touchdowns, so the answer is 0.

Tennessee threw the game's opening punch in the first quarter with a 29-yard field goal from kicker Rob Bironas, but the Steelers answered with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller.  Pittsburgh added onto their lead in the second with Roethlisberger completing a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward and a 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback David Johnson. The Steelers continued their dominating performance in the third quarter with Roethlisberger completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to Ward.  The Titans would respond with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Chris Johnson, yet Pittsburgh came right back in the fourth quarter with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 19-yard field goal.  Tennessee tried to rally as quarterback Matt Hasselbeck found wide receiver Damian Williams on a 19-yard touchdown pass, but the Steelers closed out the game with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace.\n\nQuestion:\nWho threw the second most touchdowns?",
