In the first quarter, Tennessee trailed early as Ravens kicker Matt Stover got a 38-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Titans tied the game with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Baltimore took the lead as RB Le'Ron McClain got a 1-yard TD run. Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, Tennessee rallied with Bironas nailing a 26-yard field goal, along with QB Kerry Collins completing an 11-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler. With the win, the Titans kept their perfect season alive as they entered their bye week at 5-0. During the bye week, the Titans became the only undefeated team in the NFL with the Giants' loss to the Browns in Week 6.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the difference between the first and second touchdowns in the game?",
