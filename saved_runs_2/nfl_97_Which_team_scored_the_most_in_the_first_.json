The Ravens drew first blood in the first quarter, as kicker Matt Stover kicked a 32-yard field goal for the only score of the quarter.  In the second quarter, the Browns came to life, as QB Charlie Frye completed a 58-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards and Frye managed to get a TD on a 1-yard TD run.  After a scoreless third quarter, it seemed that Cleveland would finally get its first victory, but in the fourth quarter, the Ravens managed to fly back into the game.  QB Steve McNair would complete a 3-yard TD pass to TE Todd Heap.  Finally, Stover would help Baltimore steal one from the Browns, with a 43-yard and a 52-yard field goal.  With their last-second loss, the Browns fell to 0-3.  0-2 against division rivals and 0-2 in conference games.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team scored the most in the first quarter?",
