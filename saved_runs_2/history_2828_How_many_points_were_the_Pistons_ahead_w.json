    "problem_text": "Context:\nDespite losing key members of their bench during the offseason (including Okur, Mike James (basketball, born 1975) and Corliss Williamson), the 2004-05 Detroit Pistons season were considered a strong contender to win a second consecutive title in 2005. They won 54 games during the 2004-05 NBA season, their fourth consecutive season of 50 or more wins. During the 2005 NBA Playoffs, they easily defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 4-1 and then rallied from a 2-1 deficit to finish off the 2004-05 Indiana Pacers season, 4-2. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons faced the 2004-05 Miami Heat season. Once again, the Pistons fell behind. However, they would ultimately win the series in seven games. In the 2005 NBA Finals, the Pistons faced the 2004-05 San Antonio Spurs season. After both teams split the first four games of the series, the turning point came at the end of Game 5 in Detroit, which went into overtime. The Pistons were ahead 95-93 when Robert Horry sank the game-winning three-point basket for the Spurs with 5.8 seconds left in the extra session. The Pistons fought back to win Game 6 in San Antonio, setting up the first NBA Finals Game 7 since 1994. The Pistons then lost a hard-fought, low-scoring game to the Spurs, who won their third NBA championship since 1999.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points were the Pistons ahead when the Spurs scored the game-winning basket?",
