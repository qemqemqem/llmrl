Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for \u00a31.782 billion. On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a \u00a330 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN (UK) was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009\u201310 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2011 to 2012\u201313. On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT Group had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013\u201314 through 2015\u201316 seasons at \u00a3246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky plc who paid \u00a3760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights have raised \u00a33.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010\u201311 to 2012\u201313 rights. The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid \u00a35.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018\u201319 season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many million pounds did Premier League receive for the 2013\u201314 through 2015\u201316 seasons?",
