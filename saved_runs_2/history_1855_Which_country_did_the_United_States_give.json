Reverse lend-lease policies comprised services such as rent on bases used by the U.S., and totaled $7.8 billion; of this, $6.8 billion came from the British and the Commonwealth of Nations, mostly Australia and India. The terms of the agreement provided that the materiel was to be used until returned or destroyed. In practice very little equipment was in usable shape for peacetime uses. Supplies that arrived after the termination date were sold to Britain at a large discount for \u00a31.075 billion, using long-term loans from the United States. Canada was not part of Lend Lease. However it operated a similar program called Billion Dollar Gift and Mutual Aid that sent a loan of $1 billion and $3.4 billion in supplies and services to Britain and other Allies.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich country did the United States give more money to for war expenditures, France or China?",
