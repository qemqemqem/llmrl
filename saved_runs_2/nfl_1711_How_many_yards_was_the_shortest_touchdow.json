    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the Steelers the Falcons played at home an NFC duel against the Arizona Cardinals. In the first quarter Atlanta took the early lead as QB Matt Ryan completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White, followed in the second quarter by kicker Matt Bryant hitting a 24-yard field goal. Arizona would reply with RB Tim Hightower scampering 80 yards for a TD run, but Atlanta increased their lead when Ryan threw a 19-yard TD pass to FB Jason Snelling, followed by Snelling getting a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter the Falcons continued to dominate the game when Ryan completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to WR Brian Finneran, followed by Bryan nailing a 35-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter Atlanta scored once again with FB Jason Snelling getting a 7-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest touchdown pass?",
