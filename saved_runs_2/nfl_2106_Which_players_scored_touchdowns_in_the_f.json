To answer the original question, the players who scored touchdowns in the first half of the football game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Cleveland Browns in 2010 were Mohamed Massaquoi and Peyton Hillis. \n\nTo solve the problem, I first read through the given information and identified the relevant details about the game. Then, I created a table to organize the information and make it easier to identify the players who scored touchdowns in the first half.\n\nTo improve my approach, I could have read the given information more carefully to ensure that I did not miss any important details.

In the first quarter, Jake Delhomme completed a 41-yard touchdown pass to Mohamed Massaquoi for a 7-0 lead. Buccaneers kicker Connor Barth made a 49-yard field goal to trim the deficit to 7-3.
