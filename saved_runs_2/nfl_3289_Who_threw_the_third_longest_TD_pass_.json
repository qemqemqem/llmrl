After reviewing the play-by-play of the game, I have identified that the player who threw the third longest touchdown pass was Andy Dalton. He threw an 8-yard pass to A.J. Green in the first quarter. To solve the problem, I carefully read through the play-by-play of the game and identified all the touchdown passes. Then, I noted down the length of each touchdown pass and the player who threw it. Finally, I ranked the touchdown passes in order of length and identified the player who threw the third longest touchdown pass. To solve the problem better, I could have double-checked my answer before submitting it to ensure its accuracy.",

The Bengals scored first in the first quarter when Randy Bullock kicked a 35-yard field goal to make it 3-0.  They would make it 10-0 later on in the quarter when Andy Dalton found A.J. Green on an 8-yard pass.  In the second quarter, the Bengals scored again when Dalton found Green again on a 15-yard pass to make it 17-0.  The Steelers got their only points of the first half when Chris Boswell kicked a 30-yard field goal to make it 17-3 at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Steelers were able to come within a touchdown when Ben Roethlisberger found Le'Veon Bell on a 35-yard pass to make it 17-10.  However, the Bengals moved back ahead by double digits when Bullock kicked a 41-yard field goal to make it 20-10.  In the fourth quarter, it was all Steelers when Boswell kicked a 37-yard field goal to make the score 20-13.  This would be followed up by tying the game at 20-20 when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 6-yard pass.  Finally, the Steelers were able to seal the victory with seconds left when Boswell kicked the game-winning 38-yard field goal to make the final score 23-20. With their 6th straight loss to the Steelers, the Bengals fell to 5-7.\n\nQuestion:\nWho threw the third longest TD pass?",
