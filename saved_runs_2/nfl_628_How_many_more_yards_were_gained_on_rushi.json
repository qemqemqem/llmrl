Finally, I subtracted the total number of yards gained on passing touchdowns from the total number of yards gained on rushing touchdowns to get the difference in yards, which was 10 yards.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have paid closer attention to the details in the game summary and double-checked my calculations to avoid making a mistake.",

In the first quarter, the Colts trailed early as Houston WR Jerome Mathis returned a kickoff 84&#160;yards for a touchdown. QB Peyton Manning completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark.  In the second quarter, the Texans would retake the lead with kicker Kris Brown getting a 33-yard. RB Joseph Addai helped Indianapolis get back ahead with an amazing 4-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Colts pulled away as kicker Adam Vinatieri got a 36-yard field goal, Addai got an 8-yard TD run, and Vinatieri kicked a 28-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Houston tried to catch up with RB Samkon Gado getting a 1-yard TD run, while Indianapolis got its final score of the game with a Vinatieri kicking a 35-yard field goal.  The Texans would get close with QB Matt Schaub completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Vonta Leach. The Colts held on to get the victory.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more yards were gained on rushing touchdowns relative to passing touchdowns?",
