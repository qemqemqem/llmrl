    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their divisional road win over the Panthers, the Saints went home for a Week 13 NFC South rematch with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first quarter, New Orleans trailed early with Buccaneers kicker Matt Bryant getting a 27-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Saints took the lead with QB Drew Brees completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Terrance Copper.  In the second quarter, Tampa Bay regained the lead with QB Luke McCown completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Anthony Becht, along with Bryant nailing a 31-yard field goal.  Afterwards, New Orleans retook the lead with Brees completing a 45-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. In the third quarter, the Buccaneers regained the lead with RB Earnest Graham getting a 25-yard TD run.  Later, the Saints retook the lead with CB Mike McKenzie returning an interception 53 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, New Orleans increased its lead with DE Will Smith taking McCown down in his endzone for a safety.  However, an attempted double reverse resulted in a lost fumble.  It would allow Tampa Bay to get into position for the win, as McCown completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Jerramy Stevens.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Bryant's second field goal compared to his first?",
