To solve the problem, I subtracted the starting year of the period being referred to in the report (2001) from the current year (2021), which gave me 20. However, this approach was incorrect because the report did not state that the killings occurred over the entire period from 2001 to the present. Instead, the report only provided a range of the number of terrorists killed since 2001. Therefore, a better approach would have been to subtract the starting year (2001) from the ending year of the period being referred to in the report, which was not explicitly stated. However, based on the context of the report, it can be inferred that the period ended in 2014 when the US combat mission in Afghanistan officially ended. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.",
