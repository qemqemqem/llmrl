In the first quarter, Cleveland led early with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 51-yard field goal.  However, the Ravens took the lead with RB Jamal Lewis getting a 7-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Kyle Boller took over at QB for the Ravens after starting QB Steve McNair went out with a hand injury.  Baltimore's lead increased when Boller completed 9-yard TD pass to FB Ovie Mughelli and  kicker Matt Stover completed a 38-yard field goal.  However, the Browns showed signs of life as QB Derek Anderson completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Joe Jurevicius.  In the third quarter, Cleveland tied the game at 17-17 with Anderson's 14-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  However, the Ravens took over for the rest of the game with Boller's 77-yard TD pass to WR Demetrius Williams.  In the fourth quarter, Baltimore wrapped the game up with Stover's 22-yard field goal.  With the loss, the Browns fell 4-10.  For the first time in the history of the Cleveland Browns, the team did not win a game in their own division.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team lead after the first quarter?",
