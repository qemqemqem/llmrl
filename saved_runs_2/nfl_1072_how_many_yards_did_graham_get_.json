In the first quarter, Houston drew first blood as WR Jacoby Jones returned a punt 73 yards for a touchdown.  The Bengals responded with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 43-yard field goal.  The Texans increased their lead as QB Matt Schaub completed a 6-yard TD pass to WR David Anderson.  Cincinnati would close out the half as Graham nailed a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston began to pull away as Schaub completed a 7-yard and a 39-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter.  In the fourth quarter, the Texans closed out their home stand in style with rookie RB Steve Slaton getting a 20-yard TD run. With the win, not only did Houston improve to 3-4, but they won three straight games for the first time in franchise history.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did graham get?",
