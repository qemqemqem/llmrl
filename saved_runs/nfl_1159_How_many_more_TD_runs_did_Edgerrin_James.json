    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from a tough MNF road loss to the Chargers, the Jets went home, donned their New York Titans throwbacks, and played a Week 4 interconference duel with the Arizona Cardinals.  After a scoreless first quarter, New York would begin their explosive second quarter.  It began with QB Brett Favre completing a 12-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.  It continued with CB Darrelle Revis returning an interception 32 yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, New York kept its domination going with Favre completing a 34-yard TD pass to Coles, kicker Jay Feely getting a 20-yard field goal, Favre and Coles hooking up with each other for a third time on a 2-yard TD pass, and Feely kicking a 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Cardinals started to rally as RB Edgerrin James got a 4-yard and a 2-yard TD run, while RB Tim Hightower got a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets answered with Favre completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery.  Arizona replied with QB Kurt Warner completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin, yet New York continued its victory march as Favre completed a 40-yard TD pass to Cotchery.  The Cardinals tried to come back as Warner completing a 14-yard TD pass to WR Jerheme Urban, yet the Jets were able to close out the game as Favre threw his career-best sixth touchdown pass to rookie TE Dustin Keller from 24 yards out. In the final minute, Anquan Boldin suffered fractured paranasal sinuses as a result of a helmet-to-helmet collision. After witnessing the injury, Kurt Warner considered retirement, but remained to lead the Cardinals to Super Bowl XLIII. With the amazing win, New York went into the bye week at 2-2. The Jets' 34-second quarter points became a franchise record for the most points in any given quarter.  The defense was also impressive with 5 sacks and 7 turnovers.  Also, heading into the game, Favre was listed as questionable, due to an injury from MNF.  He improved to 6-1 in career games where he's listed as questionable.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more TD runs did Edgerrin James get than Tim Hightower?",
