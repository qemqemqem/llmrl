To solve the problem, I carefully read the given information and identified the relevant details related to the number of homes affected by the 2004 floods in Bangladesh. According to the information provided, 952,000 houses were destroyed or badly damaged. Since the question asks for the number of homes that were badly damaged but not destroyed, I subtracted the number of destroyed homes (952,000) from the total number of affected homes (952,000 + 1,000,000) to get the answer of 448,000.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully to ensure that I understood exactly what was being asked.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe effects of flooding can be devastating and cause significant damage to crops and houses, serious bank erosive with consequent loss of homesteads, school and land, and loss of many lives, livestock and fisheries. During the 1998 flood, over 70% of the land area of Bangladesh was inundated, affecting 31 million people and 1 million homesteads. In the 1998 flood which had an unusually long duration from July to September, claimed 918 human lives and was responsible for damaging 16 00 and 6000 km of roads and embankments respectively, and affecting 6000 km2 of standing crops. The 2004 floods, over 25% of the population of Bangladesh or 36 million people, was affected by the floods; 800 lives were lost; 952 000 houses were destroyed and 1.4 million were badly damaged; 24 000 educational institutions were affected including the destruction of 1200 primary schools, 2 million governments and private tubewells were affected, over 3 million latrines were damaged or washed away, this increases the risks of waterborne diseases including diarrhea and cholera. Also, 1.1 M ha of rice crop was submerged and lost before it could be harvested, with 7% of the yearly aus (early season) rice crop lost; 270 000 ha of grazing land was affected, 5600 livestock perished together with 254 00 poultry and 63 MT of lost fish production.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more homes were badly damaged than destroyed in the 2004 floods in Bangladesh?",
