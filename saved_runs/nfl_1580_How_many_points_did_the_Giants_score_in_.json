Oakland immediately trailed in the opening period as Giants running back Ahmad Bradshaw got a 1-yard and a 19-yard touchdown run.  Things continued to get worse for the Raiders in the second quarter as quarterback Eli Manning completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mario Manningham and hooked up with wide receiver Hakeem Nicks.  Oakland would answer with a 5-yard touchdown run from running back Michael Bush, yet New York closed out the half with a 25-yard field goal by kicker Lawrence Tynes.  For the second half, the Giants would stay in control as quarterback David Carr got a 12-yard touchdown run and Tynes would boot a 33-yard and a 37-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Giants score in the second half?",
