To correctly answer the question, I should have added the yardage of all three touchdown passes thrown by Eli Manning, which would be 35 + 33 + 8 = 76 yards. However, the question asks for the total yards of touchdowns, not just the yards of the touchdown passes. Therefore, I should have also included the yards gained on the plays that resulted in touchdowns. Based on the information provided in the passage, I can see that the Giants scored four touchdowns, and the yardage gained on those plays were 35, 33, 8, and 65 yards. Adding those up gives a total of 141 yards of touchdowns. Therefore, the correct answer is 141.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Vikings the Giants played on home ground for an NFC East rivalry rematch against the Eagles. The Giants suffered their worst loss of the season, blowing a 24-3 halftime lead and allowing a punt return for a touchdown as time expired in regulation. In the first quarter the Giants took the early lead as QB Eli Manning completed a 35-yard TD pass to WR Mario Manningham. The Eagles responded in the second quarter with kicker David Akers getting a 34-yard field goal, but the Giants extended their lead after Manning found Manningham on a 33-yard TD pass, followed by kicker Lawrence Tynes nailing a 25-yard field goal, then with Manning getting an 8-yard TD pass to WR Hakeem Nicks. The Eagles cut the lead with QB Michael Vick making an 8-yard TD pass to WR Jeremy Maclin, but the Giants scored with Manning finding TE Kevin Boss on an 8-yard TD pass. However, they failed to maintain this lead with Vick making a 65-yard TD pass to TE Brent Celek, followed by his 4-yard scramble for a touchdown and then his 13-yard TD pass to Maclin to tie the game at 31. After the Giants went three and out Matt Dodge's punt was returned 65 yards for a touchdown by DeSean Jackson, giving the Giants a loss, and thus bringing their record down to 9-5. In calling the final play, Fox commentator Joe Buck said: Eagles broadcasters Merrill Reese and Mike Quick called the play on WYSP-FM in Philadelphia this way:\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards of touchdowns did Eli Manning have?",
