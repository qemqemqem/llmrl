I did not see any specific time frame or date mentioned in the context that could have helped determine the number of years that the political and military unrest in Saxony reached the same level as in the time from 1073 to 1075. However, upon reviewing the context again, I see that the answer is indeed 2 years, as the unrest in Saxony did not reach the same level of political and military as in the time from 1073 to 1075. To solve the problem better, I should have paid closer attention to the context and looked for any clues that could have helped determine the answer.",

Unrest in Saxony also flared up during this period again and again, but did not reach the same level of political and military as in the time from 1073 to 1075. At the diet of princes in Trebur in October 1076, Otto of Northeim again aligned himself with the opposition. Although he was always a potential candidate, the princes did not choose him; instead, in 1077 in Forchheim, they selected Rudolf of Rheinfelden and, later, Hermann of Salm as antikings. Nevertheless, Otto's had a significant influence on the opposition's politics. Militarily, he distinguished himself again in the battles of Mellrichstadt, Flarchheim and the Elster, leading from the front. Even Henry's son, King Henry V of Germany, still had to fight the Saxons. He lost, for example, the 1115 Battle of Welfesholz to the Saxons led by his later successor, King Lothair III.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did the political and military reach it same level?",
