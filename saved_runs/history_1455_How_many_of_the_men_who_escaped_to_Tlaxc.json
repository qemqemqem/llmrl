Maxixcatzin, Xicotencatl the Elder and Chichimecatecle told Cort\u00e9s's men: \"Consider yourselves at home. Rest...do not think it a small thing that you have escaped with your lives from that strong city...if we thought of you as brave men before, we consider you much braver now.\":306-07 Cort\u00e9s got reinforcements when the Panuco River settlement was abandoned, and supply ships arrived from Cuba and Spain. Cort\u00e9s also had built 13 brigantines then had them mounted with cannons, turning Lake Texcoco into a strategic body of water to assault Tenochtitlan. Xicotencatl the Younger, however, sought an alliance with the Mexicans, but was opposed.:309-11 Cort\u00e9s sent Diego de Ordaz, and the remnants of Navarez's men, on a ship to Spain, and Alonso de \u00c1vila on a ship to Santo Domingo to represent his case in the Royal Courts.:311 Cort\u00e9s was able to pacify the country, after the indigenous realized the Spaniards put \"an end to the rape and robbery that the Mexicans practised.\" Finally, Xicotencatl the Elder, baptized as Don Lorenzo de Vargas, agreed to support Cort\u00e9s's expedition against Texcoco. According to Bernal Diaz, he sent more than ten thousand warriors under the command of Chichimecatecle as Cort\u00e9s marched on the day after Christmas 1520.:309, 311-12\n\nQuestion:\nHow many of the men who escaped to Tlaxcala were not wounded?",
