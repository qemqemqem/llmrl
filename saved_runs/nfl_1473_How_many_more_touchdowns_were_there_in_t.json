To solve the problem, I should have counted the number of touchdowns scored by each team in the first and second halves separately. In the first half, there were three touchdowns scored (two by the Texans and one by the Bengals), while in the second half, there was only one touchdown scored by the Texans. Therefore, the difference between the number of touchdowns scored in the first half and the second half is three. To solve the problem better, I should have paid closer attention to the details in the context and counted the touchdowns scored by each team separately in each half.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Cardinals, the Texas flew to Paul Brown Stadium for a Week 6 duel with the Cincinnati Bengals.  Houston would get off to a fast first quarter start as quarterback Matt Schaub found tight end Owen Daniels on a 12-yard touchdown pass.  The Bengals answered in the second quarter with a 10-yard touchdown run from running back Cedric Benson, yet the Texans would reply with Schaub completing a 38-yard touchdown pass to running back Steve Slaton.  Cincinnati would close out the half with quarterback Carson Palmer's 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Laveranues Coles, followed by kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 50-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston stormed right back with Schaub completing a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jacoby Jones and a 7-yard touchdown pass to Daniels.  Afterwards, the defense held to preserve the 11-point lead.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more touchdowns were there in the first half than the second?",
