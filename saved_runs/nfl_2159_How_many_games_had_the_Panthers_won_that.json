    "problem_text": "Context:\n The Panthers' first home game of the season was a duel against the defending super bowl champions, the Green Bay Packers. Cam Newton threw for once again another 400+ yard game, becoming the first rookie ever to do so and only the 6th quarterback in NFL history to accomplish such a feat. Newton picked up where he left off against the Cardinals with an early score with 9:26 left in the 1st quarter of the game. The Panthers would lead 13-7 at halftime, stunning the defending Super Bowl champions. However, Green Bay would come back when Aaron Rodgers threw a 49-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Greg Jennings to put the Packers up 14-13. A big game-changer was when there was 9:31 left in the 3rd quarter of the game. Cam Newton found Steve Smith, but Smith fumbled the football and Charles Woodson picked it up. Another big game changer was on a 4th and 4 at the Packers 6-yard line with 3:23 left in the game, score being 23-16 Packers, Cam Newton tried to scramble for the first down, but was 2 yards shy. The Packers would go on to win the game, 30-23, a much closer game than expected, but the Panthers still fell to 0-2 on the season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many games had the Panthers won that season?",
