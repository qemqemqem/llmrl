Food does not significantly affect the Tmax of gabapentin and increases the Cmax of gabapentin by approximately 10%. The Tmax of the modified-release dosage (medicine) (IR) formulation of gabapentin enacarbil (as active gabapentin) is about 2.1 to 2.6 hours across all doses (350-2,800 mg) with single administration and 1.6 to 1.9 hours across all doses (350-2,100 mg) with repeated administration. Conversely, the Tmax of the modified-release dosage (medicine) (XR) formulation of gabapentin enacarbil is about 5.1 hours at a single dose of 1,200 mg in a fasted state and 8.4 hours at a single dose of 1,200 mg in a fed state.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many hours can be taken for all doses than single doses?",
