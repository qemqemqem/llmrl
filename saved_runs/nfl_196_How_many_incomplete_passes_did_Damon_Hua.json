    "problem_text": "Context:\n The Chiefs opened the regular season at home against the Cincinnati Bengals on September 10.  The game was broadcast on CBS at noon Kansas City time. The Chiefs' offense began at a slow pace, while their defense initially held the Bengals to a field goal within the first few minutes.  The Bengals began to rip through the Chiefs' defense with the help of Rudi Johnson, who would later go on to rush for 96&#160;yards and a touchdown. In the third quarter, quarterback Trent Green received a concussion when he slid past the first-down marker and was hit byRobert Geathers' shoulder.  Green laid motionless for eleven minutes until he was taken off the field by a stretcher.  The mood of the game changed instantly when the Chiefs lost their leader, and many fans began to leave Arrowhead Stadium due to heavy rain and the dwindling score. Back-up quarterback Damon Huard came into the game and completed 12 of 20 passes for 140&#160;yards and a touchdown, and was sacked four times.  Tight end Tony Gonzalez caught his first touchdown pass of the season and helped bring the score to 20-10.  The Bengals left with their first win of the 2006 season as the Chiefs began their season 0-1.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many incomplete passes did Damon Huard throw?",
