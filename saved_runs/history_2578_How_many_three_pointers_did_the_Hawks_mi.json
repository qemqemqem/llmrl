To answer the question, I would need to look for information about the number of three-pointers attempted and made by the Hawks in the given context. The context mentions that the Hawks went 20-of-36 for three-pointers against the Sacramento Kings, which means they made 20 three-pointers. Therefore, the number of missed three-pointers would be 36-20=16. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the context more carefully and paid closer attention to the information about the Hawks' three-point shooting performance.

The 2015 All-Star Game consisted of four Hawks All-Stars including Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver and Al Horford. On March 9, 2015, Kyle Korver and DeMarre Carroll each scored 20 points to help the Hawks become the first NBA team to 50 wins in 2014\u201315, scoring a season-high in routing the Sacramento Kings 130-105. The Hawks also set a franchise record by going 20-of-36 for three-pointers, breaking the mark of 19 set against the Dallas Mavericks on December 17, 1996. On March 20, 2015, the Hawks clinched their first division title in over two decades and became the first team not based in Florida to win the NBAs Southeast Division (NBA); one week later, with a win over Miami as well as a Cleveland loss to Brooklyn, the Hawks clinched the top seed in the 2015 NBA Playoffs. The team finished a franchise-best 60-22.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many three pointers did the Hawks miss?",
