    "problem_text": "Context:\nStarter Dexter Jackson was inactive for the game due to injury. Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Ravens, the Bengals played their Week 2 home opener against the Tennessee Titans. At the beginning of the game the winds were marked at 20&#160;mph and picked up intensity as the game continued, with gusts to hurricane force at times due to the passage of the remnants of Hurricane Ike. After a scoreless first quarter, Cincinnati trailed as Titans RB LenDale White got a 1-yard TD run.  The Bengals would respond with RB Chris Perry getting his first career TD on a 13-yard run.  However, Tennessee would begin its domination with QB Kerry Collins completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Justin Gage.  In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as kicker Rob Bironas nailed a 34-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Titans sealed the win with LB Keith Bulluck blocking and recovering a punt within Cincy's endzone for a touchdown. During the game, the wind was such a factor that it aided the Titan's punter who, with a quick 1-step drop, kicked a punt travelling 70 yards past scrimmage before hitting the ground. It appeared to contribute to difficulties with short passes and long snaps.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many rushing touchdowns did the teams combine for?",
