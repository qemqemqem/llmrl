    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Colts faced the Miami Dolphins in week two, a rematch of the 23-20 Colts victory during the 2012 season.  This game also marked the second meeting between Andrew Luck of the Colts and Ryan Tannehill of the Dolphins, both sophomore quarterbacks.  Indianapolis, who received the opening kickoff, were unable to score on their first drive, unlike the Dolphins who drove down 58 yards in six plays, while scoring on a Tannehill pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace, giving the Dolphins an early 7-0 lead.  The Colts would respond with a long drive of their own, however they would be able to put it into the endzone, settling instead for an Adam Vinatieri field goal.  The Dolphins would strike again, this time scoring in just two plays following a Tannehill 67-yard pass and a Lamar Miller touchdown run.  The Colts, who entered the second quarter trailing 14-3, quickly scored their first touchdown on the day with an Andrew Luck pass to tight end Coby Fleener.  After trading possessions, the Indianapolis offense would strike again, scoring their second touchdown of the quarter and taking the first lead of the day, though it would be taken away by a Caleb Sturgis field goal to end the half, with the teams going into halftime tied at 17.  Indianapolis would drive down on their first possession of the second half, though a touchdown would be nullified by an illegal shift penalty and forcing the Colts to settle for a field goal.  Midway through the third quarter, the Dolphins would score the go ahead touchdown on a Charles Clay run, putting them ahead 24-20.  On their last offensive possession of the day, Luck and the Colts would drive down to the Miami 23 yard line, though the comeback would fall short following a sack of Luck on fourth down. With the loss, the Colts went to 1-1 on the season and lost their first home game since September 23, 2012.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Miami score in the first quarter?",
