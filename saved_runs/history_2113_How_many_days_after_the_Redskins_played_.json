    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn April 6, 1997, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke died of Heart failure at the age of 84.  In his will, Cooke left the Redskins to the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, with instructions that the foundation sell the team. His estate, headed by son John Kent Cooke, took over ownership of the Redskins and at his memorial service, John Kent Cooke announced that the new stadium in Landover, Maryland would be named Jack Kent Cooke Stadium.  On September 14, 1997, the Redskins played in their new stadium for the first time, and beat the 1997 Arizona Cardinals season, 19\u201313 in overtime.  On November 23, 1997, they played the 1997 New York Giants season and the result was a 7\u20137 tie, the Redskins first tie game since the 1971 Washington Redskins season. They would finish 1997 Washington Redskins season 8\u20137\u20131 and would miss the 1997\u201398 NFL playoffs for a fifth season in a row. One bright spot during the season, however, occurred on December 13, 1997, when Darrell Green played in his 217th career game as a Redskin, breaking Monte Colemans record for games played.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many days after the Redskins played in their new stadium for the first time did Darrell Green play in his 217th career game?",
