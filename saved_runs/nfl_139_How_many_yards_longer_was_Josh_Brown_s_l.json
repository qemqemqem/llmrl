To solve the problem, I needed to find the difference between the length of Josh Brown's longest field goal and Jason Hanson's longest field goal. From the given information, I know that Hanson's longest field goal was 44 yards, and Brown's longest field goal was 51 yards. Therefore, the difference between the two is 51 - 44 = 7 yards. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully to ensure that I was finding the correct difference between the two field goals. Additionally, I could have double-checked my calculations to avoid making a mistake.",

The Lions would score first on kicker Jason Hanson's 44-yard field goal in the first quarter.  However, in the second quarter, Seattle would get back in the game with kicker Josh Brown's 20-yard and 51-yard field goals. After a scoreless third quarter, the Lions would tie in the fourth quarter with Hanson booting a 37-yard field goal, but Seattle got a last-second win with a 42-yard field goal in the closing seconds. With the season-opening loss, the Lions were 0-1.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Josh Brown's longest field goal over Jason Hanson's longest field goal?",
