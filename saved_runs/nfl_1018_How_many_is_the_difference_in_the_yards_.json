New York answered with a 34-yard field goal from John Carney. As New York tried to get a drive going they contended with the a Dallas defence that leads the league in sacks.  Quarterback Eli Manning was brought down eight times during the game.  In the fourth quarter Dallas extended its small lead with a 1-yard touchdown pass to full back Deon Anderson.  After a mistake by the Dallas offensive line the Giants scored a safety.  Later John Carney nailed a 47-yard field goal to make the score 14-8 for Dallas.  With 2:24 left on the clock Dallas sealed the win with a 38-yard touchdown run by Tashard Choice.  The two-point conversion failed. With the win, Dallas improved to 9-5. This would be the last Cowboys win at Texas Stadium and for the 2008 NFL Season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many is the difference in the yards of the pass to Crayton and the yards of the TD pass caught by Anderson?",
