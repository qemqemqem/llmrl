Extremes recorded at the station include the highest air temperature of  on 29 June 1976, the lowest air temperature of  on 2 January 1979 and the lowest ground temperature of  on 12 January 1982. The maximum daily sunshine was 16.3 hours on 18 June 1978. The warmest and sunniest month on record in Kilkenny was August 1995 with a total of 274.9 hours Sunlight and very high temperatures throughout. The maximum daily sunshine was 16.3 hours on 18 June 1978. The overall trend in temperatures has been on the rise with a marked increase from 1988 onwards. Annual temperatures are running over 0.5 degrees above 20th-century levels.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years was the time span where the highest air temperature occurred and the lowest air temperature were recorded at the Met \u00c9ireann Weather station",
