    "problem_text": "Context:\n Trying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Texans went home for a Week 14 interconference duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first quarter, Houston drew first blood as QB Sage Rosenfels completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Buccaneers got on the board with RB Earnest Graham getting a 4-yard TD run.  Afterwards, Houston answered with Rosenfels completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter. In the third quarter, the Texans immediately increased their lead as WR Andr&#233; Davis returned the half's opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown.  Tampa Bay would respond with Graham getting an 11-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Houston ended the game with Rosenfels completing a 4-yard TD passe to TE Owen Daniels. For DE Mario Williams (the 1st pick of last year's draft), his 1 sack in the game increased his season total to a franchise-best 9.5 sacks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest touchdown run?",
