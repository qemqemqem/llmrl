    "commentary_on_process": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. To solve the problem, I first calculated that 26% of households did not have a car (100% - 74%), which is approximately 620,390 households (26% of 2,381,500). Then, I calculated that around 8% of households did not have a mobile phone (100% - 92%), which is approximately 190,520 households (8% of 2,381,500). Finally, I found the difference between the two, which is approximately 429,870 households. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have calculated the exact number of households that did not have a car and the exact number of households that did not have a mobile phone, instead of using approximations.
