    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their Sunday night home win over the Patriots, the Colts flew to Heinz Field for a Week 10 duel with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  In the first quarter, Indianapolis trailed early as Steelers RB Mewelde Moore got a 1-yard TD run.  The Colts immediately responded with QB Peyton Manning completing a 65-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.  In the second quarter, Pittsburgh answered with Moore getting another 1-yard TD run, along with kicker Jeff Reed getting a 42-yard field goal.  Indianapolis closed out the half with Manning completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark. In the third quarter, the Colts tied the game with kicker Adam Vinatieri getting a 36-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Steelers regained the lead as Reed nailed a 24-yard field goal.  Indianapolis took the lead as Manning completing a 17-yard TD pass to RB Dominic Rhodes, along with the defense preventing any Pittsburgh comeback. This was the Colts' first win in Pittsburgh since 1968. With the win, the Colts improved to 5-4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Jeff Reed's longest field goal than his shortest?",
