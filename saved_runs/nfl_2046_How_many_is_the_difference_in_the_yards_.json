In the first quarter the Chargers took the early lead as QB Philip Rivers completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates. The Chiefs replied when RB Jamaal Charles made a 56-yard TD run. In the 2nd quarter the Chargers fell behind when QB Matt Cassel completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Moeaki. This was followed by WR Dexter McCluster returning a punt 94&#160;yards to the endzone for a touchdown. In the third quarter the Chargers cut the lead when QB Philip Rivers threw a 59-yard TD pass to WR Legedu Naanee. In the 4th quarter the Chiefs defense prevented any more scoring from the Chargers.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many is the difference in the yards of the TD pass to Gates and the TD pass to Moeaki?",
