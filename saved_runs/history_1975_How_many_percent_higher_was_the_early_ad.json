The early-decision admission rate for the class of 2020 was 47.7%, out of 787 applications. The median SAT Combined was 2080, with median subscores of 700 in Math,  in 705 Critical Reading, and 720 in Writing. The Median ACT score was 32. The average Grade (education) of the class of 2021 was 96.13 on a 100-point scale and 4.12 on a 4.0 scale. In 2015 Barnard announced that it would admit transgender women who \"consistently live and identify as women, regardless of the gender assigned to them at birth\", and would continue to support and enroll those students who transitioned to males after they had already been admitted.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percent higher was the early admission rate than the admission rate overall?",
