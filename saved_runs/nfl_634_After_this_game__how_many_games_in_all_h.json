    "problem_text": "Context:\nGame SummaryThe San Diego Chargers got out to a fast start from Darren Sproles' 89-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown. After a later field goal, Sproles would follow up with a 45-yard punt return for a touchdown in the first quarter. He became only the second player in NFL history, and first since 1958, to return a kickoff and a punt for touchdowns in the opening quarter. San Diego failed on the subsequent two-point conversion to lead 16-0. With 8:47 left in the second quarter, LaDainian Tomlinson rushed for a four-yard touchdown to give the Chargers a 23-0 advantage. Peyton Manning would lead the Colts down the field and capped the drive with an 8-yard TD pass to receiver Reggie Wayne. Later, in the fourth quarter, Manning threw a 7-yard score to running back Kenton Keith. Twenty-five seconds later, linebacker Gary Brackett recovered a fumble in the endzone for a touchdown. The Colts attempted a rush for the two-point conversion to tie the game 23-23, but were held short. With a 23-21 lead, the Colts got the ball back with only a few minutes left in the game. They marched down the field into San Diego territory. On fourth down with 1:31 remaining, Adam Vinatieri was put in for a 29-yard field goal try. Vinatieri, despite being known for his clutch kicks and having over a 95% success rate in field goals under 30&#160;yards, missed wide to the right. Vinatieri missed an earlier 42&#160;yard try at the end of the half, going 0-2 in the game. It was the first time since 2001 Vinatieri was 0-2 kicking field goals. The Colts would get the ball back, but Manning would seal a Chargers win by throwing an interception with no time remaining. Manning struggled in the game, throwing a career-high 6 interceptions. The mark is also a Colts franchise record. Chargers cornerback Antonio Cromartie had three interceptions in the game, becoming one of only 11 Chargers to have three picks in a single game. The Colts were heavily injured on both sides of the ball. Receivers Marvin Harrison and Anthony Gonzalez, left tackle Tony Ugoh, and tight end Dallas Clark missed the game. In perhaps the biggest blow to the Colts, Dwight Freeney injured his left foot and was carted off the field. Three days later, it was confirmed that Freeney had suffered a season-ending Lisfranc fracture. By the end of the game, a total of nine Colts on their 53-man roster either did not play due to injury or were injured in the game. The Colts dropped to 7-2, remaining in first place in the AFC South division. Meanwhile, the Chargers moved to 5-4 and clear first in the AFC West.\n\nQuestion:\nAfter this game, how many games in all had the Colts lost in the season?",
