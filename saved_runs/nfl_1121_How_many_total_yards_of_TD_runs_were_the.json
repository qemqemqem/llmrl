    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Buccaneers, the Vikings flew to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium for a Week 12 interconference duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars. In the first quarter, the Vikes got off to a fast start as LB Napoleon Harris returned a fumble 27&#160;yards for a touchdown, while RB Chester Taylor got a 3-yard TD run. The Jaguars would respond with QB David Garrard completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Williams. Minnesota would answer with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 54-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Jacksonville would get the period's only points as kicker Josh Scobee made a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikings replied with Longwell making a 32-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota pulled away as Longwell nailed a 22-yard field goal, while RB Adrian Peterson got a 16-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Jaguars were given a safety when Vikings punter Chris Kluwe ran out of the back of his endzone.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards of TD runs were there?",
