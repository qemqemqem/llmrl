    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I first identified the relevant information, which was that Zafar died on 7 November 1862 and his tomb was discovered on 16 February 1991. Then, I subtracted the year of Zafar's burial from the year of the discovery of his tomb to find the number of years after his death that his tomb was discovered. The calculation is as follows: \n\n1991 - 1862 = 129\n\nTherefore, the answer is 129. \n\nSince the problem was straightforward, there was no other way to solve it. However, if the dates were not given explicitly, I would have had to do some research to find out when Zafar died and when his tomb was discovered.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn 1862, at the age of 87, he had reportedly acquired some illness. In October, his condition deteriorated. He was \"spoon-fed on broth\" but he found that difficult too by 3 November. On 6 November, the British Commissioner H.N. Davies recorded that Zafar \"is evidently sinking from pure despitude and paralysis in the region of his throat\". To prepare for his death Davies commanded for the collection of lime and bricks and a spot was selected at the \"back of Zafar's enclosure\" for his burial. Zafar died on Friday, 7 November 1862 at 5\u00a0am. Zafar was buried at 4\u00a0pm near the Shwe Degon Pagoda at 6 Ziwaka Road, near the intersection with Shwe Degon Pagoda road, Yangon. The shrine of Bahadur Shah Zafar Dargah was built there after recovery of its tomb on 16 February 1991. Davies commenting on Zafar, described his life to be \"very uncertain\".\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after Zafar's death was his tomb discovered?",
