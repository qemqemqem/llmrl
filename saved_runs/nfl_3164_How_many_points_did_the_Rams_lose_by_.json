Case Keenum threw 4 interceptions in the game. One of the picks was on the last drive when the Rams drove down to the red zone. But a high pass landed in DRC's hands in the end zone allowing the Rams to drop 3-4 and continue on their losing streak.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Rams lose by?",
