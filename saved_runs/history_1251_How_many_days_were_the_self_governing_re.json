To solve the problem, I subtracted the date of the name change (1 June 1921) from the date the self-governing regions were named the Republic of Mountainous Armenia (26 April 1921), which gave me 36 days. However, the correct answer is 37 days, as there are 31 days in May and 6 days in June before the name was changed. To solve the problem better, I could have double-checked my calculation and taken into account the number of days in May and June.",

The ARF controlled Yerevan and the surrounding regions for almost 42 days before being defeated by the numerically superior Red Army troops later in April 1921. The leaders of the rebellion then retreated into the Syunik region. On 26 April 1921, the 2nd Pan-Zangezurian congress, held in Tatev monastery, announced the independence of the self-governing regions of Daralakyaz , Zangezur, and Mountainous Artsakh, under the name of the Republic of Mountainous Armenia and later on 1 June 1921, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many days were the self-governing regions named the Republic of Mountainous Armenia before the name was changed?",
