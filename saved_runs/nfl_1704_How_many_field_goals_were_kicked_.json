In the second quarter the Cardinals trailed early as QB Brett Favre got a 12-yard TD pass to RB Adrian Peterson. They immediately replied with a 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by RB LaRod Stephens-Howling. The Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 21-yard field goal. The Cardinals replied a took the lead with QB Derek Anderson completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Andre Roberts. This was followed by DB Michael Adams returning a fumble 30 yards for a touchdown, and with kicker Jay Feely making a 22-yard field goal. The lead was closed down by Peterson as he got a 4-yard TD run, and by QB Brett Favre's 25-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe. After overtime the decision was made when Longwell successfully made a 35-yard field goal to give the Cardinals a loss, bringing their record down to 3-5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were kicked?",
