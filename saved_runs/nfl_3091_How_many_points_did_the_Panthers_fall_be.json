To solve the problem, I first identified the relevant information, which was that the Panthers had a 17-3 lead over the Chiefs going into the fourth quarter. However, I misinterpreted the question and thought it was asking how many points the Panthers were ahead by, rather than how many points they fell behind by. To solve the problem correctly, I would subtract the final score of the Chiefs (20) from the Panthers' score going into the fourth quarter (17), which gives a difference of 3 points. In the future, I will make sure to read the question more carefully and double-check my calculations to avoid errors.",
