    "problem_text": "Context:\nOriginally scheduled for 1 p.m. EST on Sunday, December 12, this game was moved to Monday night after severe blizzard conditions in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area that forced the Giants to spend the night in Kansas City after their flight was diverted, while the operators of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome asked for more time to clear all the snow from the stadium's bubbled roof. The roof later collapsed, forcing the NFL to use Ford Field in Detroit as an alternate site. The game aired on WNYW in New York City, WXXA-TV in Albany, and KMSP-TV in Minneapolis-St. Paul, along with the Fox affiliates in Duluth, Mankato and Rochester. But even the disaster in Minneapolis was overshadowed by another major headline: Vikings quarterback Brett Favre was listed as inactive for this game, ending his historic streak of 297 consecutive starts. Tarvaris Jackson, who was 2-0 in his career against the Giants, started in Favre's place. Once again, the Giants drew strength from their running game, as Jacobs and Bradshaw combined for 219 yards rushing and two touchdowns. In the second quarter, Jacobs created his longest play of the season, a 73-yard run that set up his own short touchdown. After a by-now-typical shaky start from Manning that involved two interceptions, Manning closed out the first half with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Boss (Incidentally, news about another streak was lost in the talk about Favre: Manning was making his 100th consecutive start tonight). Bradshaw's touchdown came in the third quarter, on a 48-yard run that was also his longest of the season. The New York defense had an especially memorable night, holding the normally dominant Adrian Peterson to his lowest rushing output of the year, a paltry 26 yards. Umeniyora, Barry Cofield, Rocky Bernard, Dave Tollefson, and Jonathan Goff combined for four sacks, and Keith Bulluck contributed an interception. Unfortunately, the injury bug hit the Giants again in several key places. Special-teamer Clint Sintim's season ended with a torn ACL, and Bradshaw and Manningham both left the game early with injuries to the forearm and hip flexor, respectively. Diehl, Nicks, and Smith returned from their injuries, but Smith suffered a new injury to his hamstring. Whether these players will be available for the crucial division game in Week 15 has yet to be determined. With this win, the Giants rose to 9-4 and ensured that they would improve on the previous season's record of 8-8.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest rushing play?",
