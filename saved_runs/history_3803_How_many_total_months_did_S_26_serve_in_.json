Cruising from California ports, mainly Mare Island, California, San Diego, California, and San Pedro, California, S-26 visited Hawaii in the summers of 1927-1930. She also served in the Panama Canal area from March to May 1927, and in February 1929. Departing San Diego on 1 December 1930, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 12 December. From then into 1938, S-26 served at Pearl Harbor. Sailing from there on 15 October 1938, she returned to New London on 25 March 1939. Entering a period of partial duty on 15 April that year, she resumed full duty on 1 July 1940.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total months did S-26 serve in the Panama Canal?",
