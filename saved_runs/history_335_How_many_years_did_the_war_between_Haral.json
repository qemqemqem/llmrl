    "commentary_on_process": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. To solve the problem, I subtracted the year the war broke out (1134) from the year of the Battle of Holmengr\u00e5 (1139), which gave me a difference of 5 years. However, I failed to take into account that the war did not start immediately after Harald's death in 1130, and there were some years of peace before the war broke out in 1134. Therefore, a more accurate way to solve the problem would be to subtract the year of Harald's death (1130) from the year of the Battle of Holmengr\u00e5 (1139), which gives a difference of 9 years. However, the war did not last for the entire 9 years, so we need to subtract the years of peace between Harald's death and the start of the war in 1134. As we do not know the exact duration of the peace, we cannot arrive at an exact answer, but we can estimate that the war lasted for around 3 years.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nWhen Sigurd died in 1130, Harald broke his oath. Sigurd's son Magnus was proclaimed king, but Harald also claimed the royal title, and received much support. A settlement was reached whereby Magnus and Harald would both be kings and co-rulers. Peace between them lasted until 1134, when open war broke out. In 1135 Harald succeeded in defeating and capturing Magnus in Bergen. Magnus was blinded, castrated, mutilated and imprisoned in a monastery. He was thereafter known as Magnus the Blind. At about the same time Sigurd Slembe, another man from Iceland, arrived claiming to be a son of Magnus Barefoot. He claimed to have gone through an ordeal by fire in Denmark to prove his claim. Harald did not recognize him as his half-brother. In 1136 Sigurd murdered Harald in his sleep in Bergen, and had himself proclaimed king. Harald's supporters would not accept him and had Harald's two infant sons, Sigurd Munn and Inge Crouchback, named king. Sigurd Slembe liberated Magnus the Blind from his enforced monastic life and allied himself with him. The war between Sigurd Slembe and Magnus the Blind on the one side, and Harald Gille's old supporters with his young sons on the other, dragged on until 1139, when Magnus and Sigurd were defeated in Battle of Holmengr\u00e5 fought near Hvaler. Magnus was killed in the battle, Sigurd was captured and tortured to death.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did the war between Harald's old supporters and Sigurd last?",
