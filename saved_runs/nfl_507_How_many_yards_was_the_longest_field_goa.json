    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter their season-opening loss to the Chargers, the Bears rebounded by winning their home opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. Bernard Berrian fumbled on the team's opening drive, but a staunch defensive effort held the Chiefs at bay, and eventually allowed the Bears to engineer a successful drive. John St. Clair, a reserve offensive tackle, scored the Bears' first offensive touchdown of the season from a one-yard pass from Rex Grossman. The team forced the Chiefs to punt on their next drive, which was returned for a touchdown by Devin Hester.The Chiefs scored their first points of the game after Damon Huard threw a sixteen-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Bowe. During halftime, the Bears received the Pro Team Community Award for their charity efforts. The Bears' defense held the Chiefs to only three more points, after forcing pivotal turnovers in two red zone situations and also a blocked field goal attempt. Pro Bowlers Brian Urlacher, Lance Briggs, and Tommie Harris each recorded sacks, and forced Larry Johnson and Huard to leave the game with injuries. Cedric Benson recorded his first one hundred-yard rushing game. With 20-10 win, the Bears advanced to 1-1 record. Q2 - CHI - 10:29 - 2-yard TD pass from Rex Grossman to John St. Clair (Robbie Gould kick) (CHI 7-0) Q2 - CHI - 9:33 - Devin Hester 73-yard punt return TD (Gould kick) (CHI 14-0) Q2 - CHI - 2:30 - Robbie Gould 47-yard FG (CHI 17-0) Q2 - KC - 1:24 - 16-yard TD pass from Damon Huard to Dwayne Bowe (Dave Rayner kick) (CHI 17-7) Q3 - CHI - 8:36 - Robbie Gould 38-yard FG (CHI 20-7) Q3 - KC - 3:12 - Dave Rayner 45-yard FG (CHI 20-10)\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
