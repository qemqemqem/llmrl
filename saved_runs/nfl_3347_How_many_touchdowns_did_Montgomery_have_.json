    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Packers' offense struggled for the first half against the Seahawks. On the Packers' first drive, Aaron Rodgers threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown, but an illegal block in the back penalty negated the score. Before that play Rodgers had gone his previous 251 regular season pass attempts without an interception, a career high. The Packers' defense held Seattle in check but trailed 3-0 at halftime. In the third quarter, Mike Daniels forced a fumble that Green Bay recovered at the Seattle 6-yard line, and Ty Montgomery ran in for a touchdown on the following play, giving the Packers a lead they wouldn't relinquish after that. Later Rodgers caught the Seahawks with 12 men on the field and capitalized on the free play by throwing a 32-yard touchdown to Jordy Nelson. The Packers only surrendered two field goals to Seattle for the rest of the game, giving a strong defensive showing in the season opener.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Montgomery have?",
