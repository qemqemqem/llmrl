    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their divisional road win over the Seahawks, the Cardinals went home for a Week 12 duel with the defending Super Bowl champions, the New York Giants. In the first quarter, Arizona took fight as kicker Neil Rackers got a 34-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Giants responded with RB Derrick Ward getting a one-yard TD run. The Cardinals would regain the lead with rookie RB Tim Hightower getting a four-yard TD run (with a failed extra-point attempt), yet New York answered with kicker John Carney getting a 33-yard field goal. The Cardinals would reply with Rackers making a 20-yard field goal, yet the Giants closed out the half with QB Eli Manning completing a 12-yard TD pass to WR Amani Toomer. In the third quarter, New York increased their lead as Manning completed a two-yard TD pass to FB Madison Hedgecock. Arizona would answer with Hightower getting a one-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Giants were starting to pull away as Manning completed a 10-yard TD pass to TE Kevin Boss, while Carney made a 27-yard field goal. The Cardinals tried to keep pace as QB Kurt Warner completed a five-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin, yet New York replied with Carney's 33-yard field goal. Arizona tried to come back as Rackers nailed a 44-yard field goal, but their following onside kick failed, preserving the Giants' win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
