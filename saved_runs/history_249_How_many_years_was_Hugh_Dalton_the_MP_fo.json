    "problem_text": "Context:\nFormed in 1885, the seat has the market town Bishop Auckland which has a mixed modern and historic high street, the similarly sized Barnard Castle and large areas used for agriculture, particularly hill farming on the rolling landscape that cuts into the Pennines with substantial livestock. Most housing, many small towns and most facilities were built in the prosperous era of coal mining which brought thousands of workers to live in Bishop Auckland town and neighbouring settlements. Manufacturing, including food processing and packaging, public sector employment, retail and agriculture are the main employers.  Since 1935, the constituency has returned MPs from the Labour Party; the former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Dalton, was the MP for Bishop Auckland from 1929-1931, and after regaining the seat in 1935, remained MP until 1959. Within the seat are Auckland Castle and Park, Lartington Hall, Windlestone Hall, Raby Castle, Binchester Roman Fort , The Bowes Museum, and enclosures and industrial workings on Cockfield Fell.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years was Hugh Dalton the MP for Bishop Auckland?",
