The 49ers offense, which struggled the previous two weeks and had just 6 points at halftime in this game, came alive and scored three second half touchdowns, including Carlos Hyde's 2 yard go ahead touchdown run with 1:45 left on the clock to give the 49ers a 27-23 lead. But Giants quarterback Eli Manning led the Giants down the field and threw a 12-yard touchdown to Larry Donnell with&#160;:17 left in the game. The 49ers defense was shredded for an astonishing 525 yards by the Giants offense. There were five lead changes in the game, three of them in the final 4:29 of the fourth quarter.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many lead changes were there in the final 5 minutes?",
