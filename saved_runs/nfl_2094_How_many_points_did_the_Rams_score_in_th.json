    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Rams' fourth game was played at home in an NFC west rivalry match against the  Seattle Seahawks. In the first quarter the Rams took the early lead as QB Sam Bradford completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Gibson. The Seahawks cut the lead with kicker Olindo Mare nailing a 22-yard field goal, but the Rams increased their lead when kicker Josh Brown made a 30-yard field goal, followed in the 3rd quarter by Bradford completing a 21-yard TD pass to RB Kenneth Darby. Then Josh Brown made a 31-yard field goal. With the victory, the Rams improved to 2-2, thus successfully improving on their previous season. The win also snapped a 10-game regular season losing streak to the Seahawks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Rams score in the third quarter?",
