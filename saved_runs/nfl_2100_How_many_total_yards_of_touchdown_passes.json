I added these two numbers together to get a total of 38 yards of touchdown passes made by Sam Bradford. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have taken notes while reading the passage to keep track of the relevant information.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the 49ers the Rams played inside their dome for an NFC duel with the Falcons. In the first quarter the Rams took the lead after QB Sam Bradford making a 25-yard TD pass to TE Michael Hoomanawanui. The Falcons replied with kicker Matt Bryant hitting a 42-yard field goal. The Rams increased their lead when kicker Josh Brown hit a 53-yard field goal. The lead didn't last long after QB Matt Ryan completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Brian Finneran, followed by Bryant nailing a 29 and a 24-yard field goal. The Rams tried to cut the lead with Bradford making a 13-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Gibson, but they struggled further as Ryan threw a 2-yard TD pass to TE Justin Peelle. This was followed in the fourth quarter by Bryant nailing a 21-yard field goal, and with RB Michael Turner getting a 39-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards of touchdown passes did Sam Bradford make?",
