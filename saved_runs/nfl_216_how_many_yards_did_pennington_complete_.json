    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill searching for win #2, the Dolphins kept QB Joey Harrington in the starting line-up as they flew to The Meadowlands for an AFC East fight with the New York Jets.  From the get-go, the Dolphins struggled as Jets kicker Mike Nugent kicked a 33-yard field goal for the only score of the first quarter and of the half.  In the third quarter, Nugent increased New York's lead again with another 33-yard field goal.  The Dolphins finally got on the board, as kicker Olindo Mare got a 21-yard field goal.  However, the Jets wouldn't let Miami regain itself, as QB Chad Pennington completed a 58-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.  In the fourth quarter, they hooked up with each other again on a 22-yard TD pass.  The Dolphins attempted a fourth-quarter comeback, with Harrington completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers and RB Ronnie Brown ran 1 yard for a TD, but when Mare missed what would have been a field goal in the final minute, the Dolphins sank to 1-5.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did pennington complete?",
