The Falcons took the early lead as RB Michael Turner got a 5-yard TD run. But the Buccaneers replied with RB LeGarrette Blount getting a 6-yard TD run. The Falcons scored again with QB Matt Ryan getting a 17-yard TD pass to FB Ovie Mughelli, but Tampa Bay replied with QB Josh Freeman getting a 1-yard TD pass to WR Mike Williams. The Falcons trailed for the first time in the game with kicker Connor Barth nailing a 33-yard field goal, and with Earnest Graham making a 2-yard TD pass to TE John Gilmore. The Falcons responded with Eric Weems returning a kickoff 102 yards for a touchdown, and getting the lead back with Ryan getting a 9-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes did Matt Ryan throw?",
