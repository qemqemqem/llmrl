In the first quarter, rookie Tyler Lockett returned a punt for 57 yards for a touchdown to give the Seahawks the game's first points. Jimmy Graham made his Seahawks debut,  catching a pass for 7 yards for a touchdown, as the Seahawks were now trailing the Rams, 24-21, in the 3rd quarter. However, without safety Kam Chancellor, Seattle's defense struggled all game. The loss of their defensive captain was too steep to overcome as they would go on to lose in overtime, 34-31, after Greg Zuerlein hit a 37-yard field goal with 12:06 remaining.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did graham pass?",
