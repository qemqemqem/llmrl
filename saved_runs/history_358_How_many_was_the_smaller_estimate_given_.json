    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn August 31, 1923, a squadron of the Italian Navy bombarded the Greek island of Corfu and landed 5,000 to 10,000 troops. Airplanes aided in the attack. Italian fire was concentrated on the town's Old Fortress, which had long been demilitarized and served as a shelter for refugees from Asia Minor, and on the Cities Police school at the New Fortress, which was also a refugee shelter. The bombardment lasted 15 to 30 minutes. As a result of the bombardment 16 civilians were killed, 30 injured and two had limbs amputated, while according to other sources 20 were killed and 32 wounded. There were no soldiers reported among the victims, all of whom were refugees and orphans. The majority of those killed were children. The Commissioner of the Save the Children Fund described the bombing as \"inhuman and revolting, unjustifiable and unnecessary. The prefect of Corfu, Petros Evripaios, and Greek officers and officials were arrested by the Italians and detained aboard an Italian warship. The Greek garrison of 150 men did not surrender but retired to the interior of the island. After the landing, the Italian officers were worried that British citizens may have been wounded or killed, and were relieved when they learned that there were no British among the victims. The residence of the British officer in charge of the police training school, who was away on vacation, was looted by Italian soldiers.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many was the smaller estimate given of the number of people killed?",
