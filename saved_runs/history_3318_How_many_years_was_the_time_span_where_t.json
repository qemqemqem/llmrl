    "problem_text": "Context:\nGlobal rates of caesarean section rates are increasing. In the United Kingdom, in 2008, the Caesarean section rate was 24%. In Republic of Ireland the rate was 26.1% in 2009. The Canadians rate was 26% in 2005\u20132006. Australia has a high Caesarean section rate, at 31% in 2007. In the United States the rate of C-section is around 33% and varies from 23% to 40% depending on the state in question. One out three women who gave birth in the US delivered by cesarean in 2011. In 2012, close to 23 million C-sections were done globally. At one time the rate of 10% and 15% were thought to be ideal. A higher rate of 19% may result in better outcomes. More than 50 nations have rates greater than 27%. Another 45 countries have rates less than 7.5% There are efforts to both improve access to and reduce the use of C-section. In the United States about 33% of deliveries are by C-section. The rates in the UK and Australia are 26.5% and 32.3% respectively. In China, the most recent CS rate reported was 41%. Globally, 1% of all cesarean deliveries are done without the medical need for one. Overall, the rate of caesarean section rate was 25.7% during 2004-2008.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years was the time span where the caesarean section rate was 25.7%?",
