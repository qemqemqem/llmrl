The Packers struck first blood, scoring the game's first 10 points. Then, the Seahawks and Packers traded field goals, and the Packers led 13-3 at halftime. The Seahawks scored two unanswered touchdowns to take a 17-13 lead in the third quarter. However, the Packers proceeded to score the final 14 points of the game and won, 27-17, sending the Seahawks to their second consecutive loss of the young season. With the loss, the Seahawks dropped to 0-2. It was the first double digit loss for the Seahawks in the Wilson era and tied their largest loss since Week 9 of the 2011 season, when they lost by 10 points to the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Seahawks lose by?",
