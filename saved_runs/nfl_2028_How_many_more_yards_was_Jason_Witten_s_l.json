    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Texans, the Eagles flew to Cowboys Stadium for a Week 14 NFC East duel with the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night.  Philadelphia delivered the game's opening strike with a 1-yard touchdown run from quarterback Michael Vick, but the Cowboys answered with quarterback Jon Kitna completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten.  The Eagles regained the lead in the second quarter with Vick locating offensive guard Todd Herremans on a 1-yard touchdown pass.  Afterwards, Dallas closed out the half with kicker David Buehler making a 50-yard field goal. The Cowboys took the lead in the third quarter as Buehler got a 43-yard field goal, followed by running back Felix Jones getting a 3-yard touchdown run.  Philadelphia struck back with a 39-yard field goal from kicker David Akers.  The Eagles tied the game with a 50-yard field goal from Akers, followed by Vick connecting with wide receiver DeSean Jackson on a 91-yard touchdown pass and Akers' 28-yard field goal.  Dallas tried to rally as Kitna completed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Witten, yet the Eagles held on for the victory.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more yards was Jason Witten's longest touch down compared to his shortest?",
