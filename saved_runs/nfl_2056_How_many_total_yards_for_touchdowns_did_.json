I found the total yards for each touchdown pass made by Peyton Manning and then added them together to get the total yards for touchdowns that Manning got. \n\nSince there were only two touchdown passes made by Manning, the problem was relatively straightforward. However, if there were more touchdown passes made by Manning or other quarterbacks, it would have been more challenging to calculate the total yards for touchdowns. In such cases, it would be helpful to create a table or a chart to keep track of the relevant information.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Chargers' eleventh game was an AFC duel against the Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium. They trailed early in the first quarter after QB Peyton Manning made a 4-yard TD pass to TE Jacob Tamme. They eventually pulled ahead after kicker Nate Kaeding made a 28-yard field goal, followed by ILB Kevin Burnett returning an interception 29&#160;yards for a touchdown, and then with Kaeding hitting a 33 and a 50-yard field goal. Their lead was narrowed when Manning made a 6-yard TD pass to WR Blair White, but the Chargers controlled the second half with Kaeding getting a 30-yard field goal, which was shortly followed by FS Eric Weddle returning an interception 41&#160;yards for a touchdown, then with FB Mike Tolbert getting a 3-yard TD run, and Kaeding making a 20-yard field goal, settling both teams records to 6-5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards for touchdowns did Payton Manning get?",
