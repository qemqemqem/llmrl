    "problem_text": "Context:\nEmerging from their divisional home win over the Steelers, the Bengals flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cleveland Browns in Round 1 of 2009's Battle of Ohio. Cincinnati would start out fast in the first quarter with quarterback Carson Palmer's 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco.  In the second quarter, the Bengals would add to their lead with defensive end Robert Geathers returning a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown.  The Browns would then close out the half with quarterback Derek Anderson's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Steve Heiden. Cleveland would tie the game in the third quarter with Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, the Browns would take the lead with kicker Billy Cundiff's 26-yard and 31-yard field goals.  Afterwards, Cincinnati would tie the game with Palmer and Ochocinco hooking up with each other again on a 2-yard touchdown pass (yet the following PAT was blocked).  In a back-and-forth overtime, both Ohio teams fought each for possession.  In the end, the Bengals would emerge on top as kicker Shayne Graham kicked the game-winning 31-yard field goal. With the win, Cincinnati improved to 3-1, and, with the Baltimore Ravens loss later that day, tied the Ravens for first place in the division. Following this victory, the Bengals earned the nickname the \"Cardiac Cats\" for pulling through in the clutch and coming from behind in three straight games for a victory. For three Bengals players, this game was overshadowed by events that took place thousands of miles away. Jonathan Fanene, Rey Maualuga, and Domata Peko all have family in American Samoa, which was hit by a major tsunami the Tuesday before the game. All three struggled to contact their families in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes were there?",
