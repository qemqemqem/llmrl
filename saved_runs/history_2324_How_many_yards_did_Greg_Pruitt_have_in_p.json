    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Raiders made it to their fourth Super Bowl in team history after posting a 12-4 regular season record. Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett completed 230 out of 379 (60.7 percent) passes resulting in 2,935 yards and 20 touchdowns.  His favorite target was tight end Todd Christensen, who led the NFL with 92 receptions for 1,247 yards and 12 touchdowns. Wide receivers Cliff Branch and Malcolm Barnwell combined for 74 receptions, 1,209 yards, and 6 touchdowns. But the largest impact on offense was running back Marcus Allen. In just his second NFL season, Allen led the team in rushing yards (1,014) and total yards from scrimmage (1,604), while ranking second on the team in receptions (68) and touchdowns (11). But Allen was not the only key running back on the team. Kenny King (running back) and Frank Hawkins combined for 1,119 total rushing and receiving yards, and 10 touchdowns.  Los Angeles also had a powerful special teams attack led by Greg Pruitt, who led the NFL in punt returns (58), and punt return yards (666), while adding another 604 yards returning kickoffs and rushing for 154 yards and two scores.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did Greg Pruitt have in punt returns, kickoff returns, and rushing combined?",
