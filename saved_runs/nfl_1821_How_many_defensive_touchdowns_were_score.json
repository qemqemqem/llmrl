    "problem_text": "Context:\nLooking for their second win the Cowboys flew to Lambeau Field for an NFC duel with the Packers. The second quarter saw the Cowboys trail immediately after QB Aaron Rodgers got a 9-yard TD pass to RB Brandon Jackson. This was followed by Jackson making a 2-yard TD run, and with Rodgers completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings. The Cowboys struggled further after FS Nick Collins recovered a fumble and ran 26 yards for a touchdown. The Cowboys would make their only score of the game with QB Jon Kitna making a 2-yard TD pass to WR Dez Bryant. They fell further behind after Rodgers found WR Jones on a 10-yard TD pass, and with Crosby hitting a 26-yard field goal. The Cowboys had more problems when Kitna's pass was intercepted by OLB Clay Matthews and returned 62 yards for a touchdown. With the loss, the Cowboys fell to 1-7. After the game, head coach Wade Phillips was fired and offensive coordinator Jason Garrett became the interim head coach.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many defensive touchdowns were scored in the game?",
