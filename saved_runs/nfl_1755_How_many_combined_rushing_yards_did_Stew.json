    "problem_text": "Context:\nLooking for their first win of the season, the Panthers flew home for a divisional duel against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first quarter, Tampa Bay struck first with Josh Freeman's 14-yard touchdown pass to RB Earnest Graham.  The Panthers responded with Matt Moore throwing a 37-yard touchdown pass to WR Steve Smith.  The Bucs defense dominated, holding RBs Jonathan Stewart and DeAngelo Williams to 43 and 54 yards rushing, respectively.  Moore completed 6 out of 16 passes with one touchdown and one interception, while being sacked four times. After losing a fumble, he was benched in favor of rookie Jimmy Clausen in hopes for a rally, however the Bucs defense prevented any further progress. With the loss, the Panthers fell to 0-2 for the second straight year.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many combined rushing yards did Stewart and Williams have?",
