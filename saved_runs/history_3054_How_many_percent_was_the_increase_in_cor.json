    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn 1950, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III, upon his ascension to the throne, negotiated with the British for an increase in corporate taxes, growing from 10% to 30% in 1953. A Malayan dollar$1.2 million (US$0.39 million) allotment to Brunei for war damages during the Japanese occupation of British Borneo increased from M$1 million in 1946 to M$100 million (US$32.6 million) in 1952. A five-year development plan with a budget of M$100 million was also implemented in 1953, with infrastructure receiving the largest percentage (80%) and the rest going toward social programmes. Together with the expansion of the oil and gas industry, commercialisation began to transform Bruneis capital and a large number of public buildings were constructed, along with the development of a central business district in the 1970s and 1980s. On 1 August 2007, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah gave consent for the expansion of the city from 4.97 sq mi to 38.75 sq mi.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percent was the increase in corporate taxes in 1953?",
