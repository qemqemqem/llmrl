    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their easy road win over the Browns, the Steelers debuted their special throwback uniforms and clashed with the Buffalo Bills in a Week 2 home opener.  In the first half, despite the early struggles on offense, the defense kept the Bills back.  Meanwhile, kicker Jeff Reed scored a 34-yard field goal in the first quarter, and added 28-yard and 39-yard field goals in the second quarter.  In the third quarter, Buffalo would get their only score against Pittsburgh, as kicker Rian Lindell got a 24-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Steelers took over for the rest of the game as QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 1-yard TD pass to rookie TE Matt Spaeth.  In the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh closed out the game with RB Willie Parker getting an 11-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards difference was Jeff Reed\u2019s second field goal compared to his third?",
