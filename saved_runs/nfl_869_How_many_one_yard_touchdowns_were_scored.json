In the first quarter, Tennessee got the first punch with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 33-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Titans increased its lead with QB Vince Young completing a 35-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Jones. The Saints would respond with RB Reggie Bush getting a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, New Orleans would take the lead with another 1-yard TD run by Bush. Fortunately, Tennessee would regain the lead with RB LenDale White getting a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Titans closed out the game with Young completing a 3-yard TD pass to TE Bo Scaife, while DB Vincent Fuller returned an interception 61 yards for a touchdown. Pulling off the 3 other Saints interceptions was LB Keith Bulluck.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many one yard touchdowns were scored?",
