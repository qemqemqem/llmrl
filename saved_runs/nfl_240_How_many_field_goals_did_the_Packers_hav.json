    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to keep their slim playoff hopes alive, the Vikings flew to Lambeau Field for an NFC North rematch with the Green Bay Packers in a Thursday night fight. For this game, Minnesota gave rookie QB Tarvaris Jackson the start. In the first half, the Packers took an early lead as kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 38-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 44-yard field goal in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the Vikes took the lead with CB Fred Smoot returning an interception 47 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Rayner gave Green Bay the win with a 44-yard field goal. With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 6-9, but they also got eliminated from the NFC playoff race. A huge cause for Minnesota's loss was that the offense was only able to get three first downs the entire game. Also, keeping with the fact that the Vikings are the most penalized team in the league this season, they committed 10 penalties for a loss of 68 yards.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did the Packers have in the first half?",
