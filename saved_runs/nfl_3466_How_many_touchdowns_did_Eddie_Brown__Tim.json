His favorite target was Rice, who recorded 64 receptions for 1,306 yards (a 20.4 yards per catch average) and 9 touchdowns. Craig was also a key contributor, leading the team in receptions (76) while finishing the season with a total of 2,036 combined rushing and receiving yards and 10 touchdowns, earning him the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. Fullback Tom Rathman also made a big impact, rushing for 427 yards and catching 42 passes for 387 yards.  San Francisco also had a major special teams threat in second-year receiver John Taylor (American football), who led the NFL in punt return yards (556), yards per return, (12.6), and touchdowns (2).  He also gained 228 yards on kickoff returns and 325 receiving yards on just 14 receptions (a 23.2 yards per catch average).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Eddie Brown, Tim McGee, Rodney Holman, and Ickey Woods combine for?",
