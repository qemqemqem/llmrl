    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter returning home from his first overseas tour, Benaud was prolific during the 1953-54 Australian season, which was purely domestic with no touring Test team. He contributed significantly with both bat and ball in New South Wales Sheffield Shield triumph, the first of nine consecutive titles. In the opening match of the season, he struck 158 and took 5/88 and 1/65 against Queensland. He made another century in the return match, striking 144 not out and taking a total of 2/55. Midway through the season, he played in Morriss XI in a testimonial match for Hassett, who captained the other team. Benaud scored 78 and 68 and took a total of 5/238, his dismissals being Davidson and frontline Test batsmen in a 121-run win. He then finished the summer strongly, and ended the season with 811 runs at 62.38 and 35 wickets at 30.54. Benaud was the only bowler selected for all five Tests of the English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55. He secured his place after scoring 125 against Queensland at the start of the season, although his lead-up form in two matches against England for his state and an Australian XI was not encouraging.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more strikes did Benaud get during his first match of the season compared to his second match?",
