In the second quarter, Detroit added to its lead on a 43-yard Jason Hanson field goal. Washington ended the half with another field goal. In the third quarter, the Redskins regained the lead as Suisham made a 45-yard field goal. Washington scored again when Jason Campbell completed a 50-yard pass to wide receiver Santana Moss.  In the fourth quarter, Moss returned a punt 80 yards for a touchdown. Lions quarterback Dan Orlovsky answered with a 17-yard pass to Calvin Johnson. Washington closed out the scoring with a Suisham field goal of 42 yards, and the Redskins won the game 25-17.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did orlovsky get?",
