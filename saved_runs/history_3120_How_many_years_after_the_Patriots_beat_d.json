    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I subtracted the year of the first game (2007) from the year of the second game (2008), which gave me a difference of 1 year. This means that the Colts returned to beat the Patriots by three points one year after the Patriots defeated the Colts by four points. Since there were no other games mentioned between these two matchups, this was the only way to solve the problem. Therefore, I believe that this was the best way to solve the problem.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe rivalry between the Indianapolis Colts and New England Patriots is one of the NFLs newest rivalries. The rivalry is fueled by the quarterback comparison between Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. The Patriots owned the beginning of the series, defeating the Colts in six consecutive contests including the 2003 AFC Championship game and a 2004 AFC Divisional game. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship game on the way to their win in Super Bowl XLI. On November 4, 2007 the Patriots defeated the Colts 24-20; in the next matchup on November 2, 2008, the Colts won 18-15 in a game that was one of the reasons the Patriots failed to make the playoffs; in the 2009 meeting, the Colts staged a spirited comeback to beat the Patriots 35-34; in 2010 New England Patriots season the Colts almost staged another comeback, pulling within 31-28 after trailing 31-14 in the fourth quarter, but fell short due to a Patriots interception of a Manning pass late in the game; it turned out to be Mannings final meeting against the Patriots as a member of the Colts.  After a 2011 Indianapolis Colts season that included a 31-24 loss to the Patriots, the Colts drafted Andrew Luck and in November of 2012 Indianapolis Colts season the two teams met with identical 6-3 records; the Patriots erased a 14-7 gap to win 59-24. The nature of this rivalry is ironic because the Colts and Patriots were division rivals from 1970 to 2001, but it did not become prominent in league circles until after Indianapolis was relocated to the AFC South. On November 16, 2014, the New England Patriots traveled at 7-2 to play the 6-3 Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium. After a stellar four touchdown performance by New England running back Jonas Gray, the Patriots defeated the Colts 42-20.  The Patriots followed up with a 45-7 defeat of the Colts in the 2014 AFC Championship Game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after the Patriots beat defeated the Colts by four points did the Colts return to beat the Patriots by three points?",
