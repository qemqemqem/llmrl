That was with a little help from the referee as Nicolai J\u00f8rgensen, who gave the assist, was clearly offside. This match, and all of Feyenoord European Home games were played in only a half filled stadium. These measurements were taken to avoid new penalties from the UEFA. In that same week reigning Dutch champions PSV were beaten, 0\u20131. The first loss of points was against Ajax on October 23rd 2016. The final score was 1\u20131 after goals of Kasper Dolberg and Dirk Kuyt. A week later another draw followed against SC Heerenveen On November 6th, a weakened team lost for the first time that season; relegation candidate Go Ahead Eagles won, 1-0] In the European campaign Feyenoord struggled, and after losses to Manchester United (4-0)and Fenerbah\u00e7e (0-1) the European afventure ended. In the Eredivisie the team booked big victories, such as a 6\u20131 defeat against Spartaand 0\u20134 against AZ. With a 5-point lead to second place Ajax, Feyenoord ended the year at the top of the league table.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the PSV lose by?",
