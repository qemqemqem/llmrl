In the first quarter, the Steelers score the only 3 points as Shaun Suisham nailed a 20-yard field goal to take a 3-0 lead.  The Browns however scored 21 unanswered points in the 2nd quarter when Isaiah Crowell ran for a 5-yard TD to take a 7-3 lead followed by Brian Hoyer hooking up with Jordan Cameron on a 51-yard TD pass for a 14-3 lead before finally Ben Tate ran for an 8-yard TD and took a 21-3 lead at halftime.
