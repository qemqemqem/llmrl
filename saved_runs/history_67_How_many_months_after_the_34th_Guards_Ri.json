    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe 34th Guards Rifle Division was originally formed on 29 August 1942 from the 7th Airborne Corps in the Moscow Military District. It was assigned to the 28th Army, part of the Southern Front. In April 1943, it was transferred to the 5th Shock Army, which later became part of the 4th Ukrainian Front. After participation in retaking Yenkiyevo, it was awarded the battle honour. In January 1944, it became part of the 31st Guards Rifle Corps of the 46th Army. In November 1944 it was finally transferred to the 4th Guards Army, which it was part of for the rest of the war. During Operation Konrad I, the 34th Guards were pushed back by battlegroups from the 6th Panzer Division and 8th Panzer Division. The division was disbanded in May 1946 with the 31st Guards Rifle Corps in the Central Group of Forces.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many months after the 34th Guards Rifle Division was transferred to the 5th Shock Army did it become part of the 31st Guards Rifle Corps of the 46th Army?",
