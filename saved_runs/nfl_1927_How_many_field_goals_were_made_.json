    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Vikings' second preseason game took them to San Francisco to take on the 49ers. The game marked the return of quarterback Brett Favre to the Vikings' starting lineup, but he lasted just four plays; the first was a 13-yard pass to RB Adrian Peterson for a first down, but he was sacked for a loss of 10 yards two plays later and was replaced by Tarvaris Jackson for the Vikings' next drive. By the time Favre took the field, the 49ers were already leading 7-0 via a 4-yard run from Anthony Dixon. It was not until the 2nd quarter that the Vikings got their first points on the board, with Ryan Longwell landing a 40-yard field goal. San Francisco responded with two Joe Nedney field goals in the second half before the Vikings' rookie QB Joe Webb took advantage of a gap in the 49ers defense to rush 48 yards for a touchdown, bringing Minnesota within three points with two minutes left to play. Kicker Rhys Lloyd attempted an onside kick, but it was recovered by San Francisco, and by the time the Vikings got the ball back they were on their own 8-yard line with 9 seconds left in the game. They attempted to go for the win, but Webb was sacked in the end zone for a safety as the clock ran out, giving the 49ers a 15-10 win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were made?",
