The Bears trailed early as the Patriots commanded the first half with QB Tom Brady throwing a 7-yard TD pass to TE Rob Gronkowski, followed by RB Danny Woodhead getting a 3-yard TD run, then with ILB Gary Guyton recovering a fumble 35 yards for a touchdown. This was followed by kicker Shayne Graham getting a 30 and a 25-yard field goal, and then by Brady completing a 59-yard TD pass to WR Deion Branch. The Bears fell further behind with Graham getting a 29-yard field goal. The Bears tried to come back, but only came away with a 1-yard TD run by Chester Taylor, with the fourth quarter controlled by the defense, giving them a loss.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many is the difference in yards of the TD pass to Gronkowski and the yards of the TD run by Woodhead?",
