    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their impressive road win over the Giants, the Cardinals went home for a Week 8 duel with the Carolina Panthers in a rematch of last year's divisional game. In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early as Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart got a 6-yard touchdown run.  The Cardinals would respond as quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 14-yard touchdown pass to rookie running back LaRod Stephens-Howling.  However, Carolina unleashed its fury in the second quarter with Stewart's 10-yard touchdown run, quarterback Jake Delhomme's 50-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Smith, and defensive end Julius Peppers returning an interception 13 yards for a touchdown. The Cardinals would begin their rally in the third quarter as Warner connected with tight end Ben Patrick on a 1-yard touchdown pass, but the Panthers would answer in the fourth quarter as kicker John Kasay booted a 35-yard field goal.  Arizona tried to come back as running back Tim Hightower got a 1-yard touchdown run, but Carolina would seal the win as Kasay nailed a 31-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many rushing touchdowns were there in the game?",
