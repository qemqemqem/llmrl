Black and Blue was released on May 9, 2017 by Prometheus Books. Pegues was named a Correspondent for CBS News on May 29, 2013. Four months into his tenure, he became CBS News' Transportation Correspondent. In late 2014, he was promoted to CBS News Justice and Homeland Security Correspondent, one of the most challenging and high-profile beats in network news. Prior to joining CBS News, Pegues was a reporter for WABC-TV in New York City. He received numerous Emmy Awards during his nearly ten-year run  at WABC-TV. Pegues is credited with bringing the story of David Goldman and his international fight for his son into the headlines. Jeff has also been recognized for his outstanding reporting at the height of Superstorm Sandy. As the storm crashed into New York City he reported on the rising flood water and spreading fires in Queens. In 2005, he reported on Hurricane Rita from Texas. Prior to WABC-TV, Pegues was a reporter for WBAL-TV in Baltimore, Maryland, where he earned Emmy Award nominations. At WSVN-TV, the Fox Affiliate in Miami, Florida, he worked as an evening anchor. At the time, it was the top-rated evening newscast in that market. In 2004, Jeff covered both the Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years was Pegues at CBS News before being promoted to the Justice and Homeland Security Correspondent?",
