    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn November 12, the Chiefs traveled to Dolphin Stadium to play the Miami Dolphins.  The Chiefs entered the game with a three-game winning streak and the Dolphins entered with an upset victory over the previously undefeated Chicago Bears.  The game was broadcast on CBS at 1pm Miami time. In a November 7 press conference, Herm Edwards backed off on the subject of whether Trent Green will retain his starting role.  On Election Day, Chiefs' fans were asked to vote for their choice of starting quarterback on The Kansas City Star's website.  Damon Huard won the poll with 58%.  The vote did not determine Edwards' decision, and was strictly for the fan's input. Pro Bowler Brian Waters missed the game and several other Chiefs players&#8212;including Derrick Johnson and Greg Wesley&#8212;missed the game with their own injuries.  Kansas City was 3-for-14 on third-down conversions and had the ball for only 24&#160;minutes throughout the game. The Chiefs were shut out by the end of the first half, the first time Miami had not allowed their opponents to score all season.  After the second half, the Chiefs began to regain their ground.  A fumble by Ronnie Brown gave Kansas City's Jared Allen 20-yards to recover and put the Chiefs in the red zone.  Larry Johnson would finish the opportunity from the turnover and score from 2-yards out for a touchdown.  The Chiefs now trailed 10-13 following an XPA by Lawrence Tynes. The Chiefs regained the ball after a failed offensive drive by Miami with 3:10 left in the game.  A costly sack by former Chiefs player Vonnie Holliday would put Damon Huard back within 5-yards of the end zone.  The Chiefs would not be able to rally back from the 3-point deficit following an incomplete pass to Tony Gonzalez.  The Dolphins ran the clock out for their third win of the season, and Kansas City's first loss in three games as the team fell to 5-4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many third down conversions did the Chiefs fail?",
