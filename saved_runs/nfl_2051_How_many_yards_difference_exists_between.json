    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the Raiders the Chargers flew to Edward Jones Dome for an Interconference duel with the Rams. In the first quarter San Diego trailed early as kicker Josh Brown made a 39-yard field goal, followed by QB Sam Bradford completing a 38-yard TD pass to WR Danario Alexander. The Chargers struggled further in the 2nd quarter when RB Steven Jackson got a 7-yard TD run. The Chargers replied with kicker Nate Kaeding nailing a 41-yard field goal, followed in the third quarter by FB Mike Tolbert getting a 1-yard TD run. In the 4th quarter the Rams' lead increased when Josh Brown hit a 48-yard field goal, but was cut when QB Philip Rivers made a 5-yard TD pass to WR Buster Davis. With the loss, San Diego fell to 2-4 and surpassed their 2009 loss total.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards difference exists between Josh Brown's longest and shortest field goal?",
