    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to increase their winning streak the Ravens flew to Gillette Stadium for an AFC duel with the Patriots. In the 1st quarter the Ravens got the early lead as kicker Billy Cundiff got a 26-yard field goal, but fell behind with RB BenJarvus Green-Ellis making a 2-yard TD run. The Ravens got the lead back when QB Joe Flacco made a 16-yard TD pass to TE Todd Heap, followed in the third quarter by Flacco finding WR Anquan Boldin on a 25-yard TD pass. The Patriots replied with kicker Stephen Gostkowski getting a 38-yard field goal, but the Ravens continued to score with Cundiff making a 25-yard field goal. The Patriots rallied with QB Tom Brady making a 5-yard TD pass to WR Deion Branch. This was followed by Gostkowski making a 24-yard field goal and then a 35-yard field goal in overtime to give the Ravens their second loss of the season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Billy Cundiff kick?",
