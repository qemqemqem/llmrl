    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game skid, the Rams flew to Qwest Field for a Week 3 NFC West duel with the Seattle Seahawks. In the first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Seahawks kicker Olindo Mare got a 28-yard field goal, QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Michael Bumpus, and RB Julius Jones getting a 29-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Rams got on the board as former Seahawk kicker Josh Brown got a 43-yard field goal, yet Seattle responded with RB T.J. Duckett getting a 4-yard TD run. St. Louis would answer with Brown kicking a 29-yard field goal, yet the Seahawks increased its lead with Mare kicking a 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Rams tried to rally as QB Marc Bulger completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR Dane Looker. However, in the fourth quarter, Seattle pulled away with Duckett's 1-yard TD run and Mare's 38-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Brown kick?",
