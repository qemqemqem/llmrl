    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter losing three consecutive games in a row, the Packers traveled to Seattle to face the 2007 NFC West Division Champion Seattle Seahawks. The game started with Seattle in possession of the football but the Packers quickly stopped them 3 and out. On the Packers first drive of the game they seemed to move the ball quite effectively and highlighted the drive with a 17-yard run by struggling RB Ryan Grant. However, on 3rd and 9 Ryan Grant was tackled for a 3-yard loss and the Packers were forced to punt. The Seahawks second drive of the game was another 3 and out and were again forced to punt. The Packers next drive was highlighted by a 7-yard pass to WR Donald Driver on 2nd and 6 as well as a nice 14-yard catch by rookie WR Jordy Nelson on 1st and 15. On 3rd and 10 on Seattle's 20-yard line Aaron Rodgers completed a 9-yard pass to Jordy Nelson which was marked a-yard short of the 1st down marker. Green Bay settled for the 29-yard Mason Crosby field goal to take a 3-0 lead. Seattle's next drive started off with the pocket collapsing on Seattle's 3rd string QB Charlie Frye and Charles Woodson sneaking in from his CB position for the sack. On the next play, Seahawks WR Koren Robinson who was released by the Packers during the offseason beat CB Tramon Williams for a 19-yard gain. The Seahawks drive continued into the second quarter where they had to settle for a 50-yard field goal to tie the game up at 3-3. On the Packers 1st drive of the 2nd and 3rd drive of the game, Ryan Grant carried the ball twice on 1st and 2nd downs for 2 and 5&#160;yards respectively but the Packers lost possession of the ball when Aaron Rodgers stepped up into the pocket and was sacked by Julian Peterson forcing a fumble. The ball was recovered by Seattle's Rocky Bernard for no gain at the Packers 32-yard line. With the Seahawks re-gaining possession with a short field, The Packers looked to stop the Seahawks on 3rd and 1 for no gain, but the Seahawks decided to go for it on 4th down on which they gained 9&#160;yards rushing for the first down. The first touchdown in the game was scored when QB Charlie Frye rolled out to the right and passed short to the rookie TE John Carlson for a touchdown. The Seahawks touchdown gave the Seahawks the 10-3 lead. With 8:17 remaining in the contest, the Packers next drive was highlighted by a 19-yard reception by WR Donald Driver on 3rd and 7 to the Seattle 44-yard line. After a short pass to TE Donald Lee and two 3 and 6-yard gains for a first down by RB Ryan Grant for another 1st down. Rodgers then completed a 7-yard pass to WR Donald Driver on second down paired with a face mask penalty by Jordan Babineaux which moved the ball half the distance to the goal to the Seattle 12. After a 5-yard false start penalty and a run by Ryan Grant for no gain, Rodgers rushed to the Seattle 11 for a gain of 6. On Third and 9 Rodgers passed to WR Greg Jennings for his first and only catch of the half for 9&#160;yards and a first down. On first and goal from the 2, Ryan Grant rushed the ball up the middle for a gain of a yard. The offense then came out in a 4 wide receiver set with only QB Aaron Rodgers in the backfield. Rodgers took the snap and rushed forward through the pile toward the goal line. The initial call on the field was no touchdown but after a review from the booth it was clear that Rodgers forward progress was not stopped and his knees did not contact the ground before the ball crossed the goal line. The play was ruled a touchdown which tied the game at 10-10 going into the half. Green Bay received the ball after the half but couldn't get the ball moving and had tp punt after going 3 and out. On the second play of the Seahawks first drive of the half, RB Julius Jones broke through the middle of the offensive line for a 51-yard gain but the play was called back after a holding penalty on former Packer offensive lineman Mike Wahle. The Seahawks couldn't move the ball and were forced to punt. The Packers next drive was highlighted by an 8-yard pass to WR Greg Jennings on 3rd and 6. The drive came to a halt when Rodgers completed a pass to Donald Driver on 3rd and 11 for 8&#160;yards. Seattle responded unsuccessfully with and incomplete pass, a completion for no gain and a second incomplete pass which forced them to punt. The biggest play of the game took place on the Packers next possession. On 3rd and 6 at the Seattle 45, Rodgers dropped back to pass while WR Greg Jennings sprinted past CB Marcus Trufant on the right side of the field. Rodgers through deep down field to Jennings who hauled the pass in at the 5-yard line and fell into the endzone for the lead taking touchdown. The Packers were now ahead 17-10 with a little less than 6&#160;minutes left in the 3rd. Seattle took over possession but still could not move the ball. On 3rd and Charlie Frye dropped back to pass and DE Aaron Kampman sacked him for an 8-yard loss. The Packers next drive started at the Green Bay 16. on 3rd and 6 at the 20, Rodgers passed to Greg Jennings for 8 and a 1st down. Jennings caught his second pass of the drive on 2nd down to the Green Bay 42 for 14&#160;yards. On 2nd and 8 Rodgers rolled to his right but no one was open. Rodgers pulled the ball down and ran up the sideline to the Seattle 40 for 16&#160;yards. CB Marcus Trufant was also called for defensive holding on the play and 5&#160;yards were tacked onto the end of the run. The Packers drive continued into the 4th with a nice pass to Donald Driver for a gain of 8 on 3rd and 5 to the Seattle 22-yard line. Grant rushed for 7&#160;yards on first down and 1-yard on 3rd setting up a 10-yard pass to Jordy Nelson to the Seattle 4-yard line. After a no huddle two-yard gain by Ryan Grant, Rodgers dropped back to pass on 2nd down and tossed to ball to FB John Kuhn who caught the ball on his knees for the touchdown. The Packers extended their lead to 24-10. With Seattle in a 14-point hole with 11:23 left in the game, Charlie Frye dropped back to pass on the 3rd play of the drive at Seattle's 33-yard line. Charles Woodson who was covering a wide receiver up the sideline let his receiver go and stepped in front of the crossing TE John Carlson for his 4th interception of the season. The Packers ran the ball for no gain and Rodgers was sacked on 2nd down. 3rd down was a completed to recently activated practice squad running back DeShawn Wynn for 7&#160;yards but he couldn't reach the 1st down marker. Mason Crosby then kicked a 51-yard field goal to increase the Packers lead to 27-10 with 8:41 in the game remaining. On the next drive Charlie Frye trying to lead an improbable comeback threw deep to Koren Robinson streaking down the left sideline. The ball was slightly under thrown and CB Tramon Williams intercepted the ball at the Packers 9-yard line. Tramon returned the ball to the Packers 24-yard line for 15&#160;yards. With the Packers trying to run out the rest of the clock, Ryan Grant rushed the ball twice for &#8722;1 on 1st down and 3&#160;yards 2nd down. Rodgers pass to Ruvell Martin was incomplete on 3rd down and the Packers punted. With 5:15 left in the game, The Seahawks managed to move the ball effectively against the Packers prevent style defense and managed to score their second touchdown of the day at 3:17 with a Charlie Frye 5-yard pass to WR Keary Colbert to narrow the Packers lead to 27-17. The Seahawks down by 10 with 3:14 left in the game attempted an onside kick which was recovered by CB Jarrett Bush at the Seattle 43-yard line. Ryan Grant secured the victory with a 5-yard gain on 3rd and 4. Ryan Grant ran the ball for a 6-yard gain on first down and Rodgers finished the game with two kneel downs to run out the clock.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many punts occured before a team finally scored?",
