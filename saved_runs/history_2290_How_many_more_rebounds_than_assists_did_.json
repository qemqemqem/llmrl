    "problem_text": "Context:\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991-92 NBA season, establishing a 67-15 record, topping their franchise record from 1990-91. Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on 52% shooting. After winning a physical 7-game series over the 1991-92 New York Knicks season in the second round of 1992 NBA Playoffs and finishing off the 1991-92 Cleveland Cavaliers season in the Conference Finals in 6 games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the 1991-92 Portland Trail Blazers season in 1992 NBA Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Celtics-Lakers rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \"Air\" Jordan and Clyde \"The Glide\" during the pre-Finals hype. In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals. After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying, \"I cant believe Im doing this.\" The Bulls went on to win Game 1, and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more rebounds than assists did Michael Jordan average per game?",
