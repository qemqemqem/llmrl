However, this difference does not represent the number of seats reduced in the Rose Bowl. \n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I should have researched the capacity of the Rose Bowl before and after the 1998 Rose Bowl, which is when the official capacity was lowered. Then, I could have subtracted the post-1998 capacity from the pre-1998 capacity to find the number of seats reduced. \n\nIn summary, I could have solved the problem better by gathering more information about the Rose Bowl's capacity history and being more careful in my calculations.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nFor many years, the Rose Bowl had the largest football stadium capacity in the United States, eventually being surpassed by Michigan Stadium (107,601). The Rose Bowls maximum stated seating capacity was 104,091 from 1972 to 1997. Some of the seats closest to the field were never used during this time for UCLA regular season games, and were covered by tarps. Official capacity was lowered following the 1998 Rose Bowl. Slightly different figures are given for the current capacity, for the lower level seats behind the team benches are not used for some events since the spectators can not see through the standing players or others on the field. UCLA reports the capacity at 91,136. The Tournament of Roses reports the capacity at 92,542. The 2006 Rose Bowl game, which was also the BCS championship game, had a crowd of 93,986. In the 2011 contest between TCU and Wisconsin, the listed attendance is 94,118.  As of 2008, the Rose Bowl is the 11th List of American football stadiums by capacity, and is still the largest stadium that hosts post-season bowl games. For concerts held there, the Rose Bowl holds almost 60,000 people. The stadiums 2014 remodeling removed the lower \"lettered row\" seats on each side behind the players benches and provide access in and out of the stadium for the lower sections of the Rose Bowl, restoring its original design.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many seats were reduced in the Rose Bowl using the tournament of roses report?",
