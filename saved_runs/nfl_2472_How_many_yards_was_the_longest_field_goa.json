    "problem_text": "Context:\nDue to Hurricane Sandy's aftermath, the Steelers flew to New Jersey on game day because the team was unable to find a hotel in New York. After a scoreless first quarter punt fest, the Steelers drew first blood with Ben Roethlisberger's 4-yard TD pass to Emmanuel Sanders for a 7-0 lead.  The Giants however responded to tie the game with RB Andre Brown's 1-Yard Run to make it 7-7.  After recovering a fumble, the Giants would take the lead as Michael Boley returned it 70 yards for a TD to move ahead 14-7.  The Steelers would shorten the lead to 4 with Shaun Suisham's 30-yard field goal to make the score 14-10 at halftime. After the break, the Giants would increase their lead from 7 to 10 points with 2 Lawrence Tynes field goals from 50 and 23 yards out making the score at first 17-10 then 20-10.  However, the Steelers responded in the 4th quarter with Roethlisberger finding Mike Wallace for a 51-yard catch and run pass to shorten the Giants' lead to 3 making it 20-17.  After pressuring Eli and the Giants' offense, the Steelers then drove down the field and took the lead with Redman's 2-Yard Run to make it 24-20.  Getting the ball back after the Giants' last 3 and out, Roethlisberger took a knee to end the game as the team improved to 5-3, snapping the Giants' 4-game winning streak.  Also, the Steelers would improve to 2-3 in road games and 3-0 against the NFC East.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal made in this game?",
