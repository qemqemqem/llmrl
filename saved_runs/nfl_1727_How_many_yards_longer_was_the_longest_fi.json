In  the 1st quarter the Ravens trailed early when kicker Phil Dawson made a 28-yard field goal, but got the lead back after QB Joe Flacco found WR Anquan Boldin on an 8 and a 12-yard TD pass. After that the Ravens fell behind when RB Peyton Hillis made a 1-yard TD run, followed in the 4th quarter by QB Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson. Then the Ravens replied and took the lead when Flacco made a 27-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin, followed by kicker Billy Cundiff nailing a 49-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was the longest field goal compared to the shortest?",
