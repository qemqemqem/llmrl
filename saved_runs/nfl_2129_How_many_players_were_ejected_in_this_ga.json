    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn an attempt to break a three-game losing streak the Titans flew to Reliant Stadium for an AFC South rivalry match against the Texans. The Titans trailed throughout the game as QB Matt Schaub got a 1-yard TD pass to TE Joel Dreessen, followed by his 2-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson. The lead was increased when kicker Neil Rackers hit a 35 and a 33-yard field goal. With 7:53 remaining in the 4th quarter, an altercation between Texans WR Andre Johnson and Titans CB Cortland Finnegan broke out, causing both players to be ejected for the rest of the game. Both players' helmets were torn off, then punches were exchanged in return. Despite being ejected, they avoided suspension, but were each fined $25,000 for their actions. With the shut-out loss, not only did the Titans fall to 5-6, but this also became their 3rd straight season being shut out on the road.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many players were ejected in this game?",
