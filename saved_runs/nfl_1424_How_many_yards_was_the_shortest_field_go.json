After a scoreless first quarter, Dallas trailed early after Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham nailed a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Suisham booted a 31-yard field goal to keep the Redskins in front, yet in the fourth quarter, Dallas took the lead with quarterback Tony Romo completing a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Patrick Crayton.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest field goal?",
