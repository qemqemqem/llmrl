    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I subtracted the percentage of the city's workforce from the percentage of the tax base and expressed the result as a percentage. The financial services industry makes up 31% of the tax base and 9% of the city's workforce. Therefore, 31% - 9% = 22%. So, the financial services industry makes 22% more of the tax base than the city's work. \n\nI believe this is the most straightforward and efficient way to solve the problem. However, it's always good to double-check the calculations and make sure that the units are consistent throughout the calculation.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nEstimates vary about the number and quality of financial jobs in the city. One estimate was that Wall Street firms employed close to 200,000 persons in 2008. Another estimate was that in 2007, the financial services industry which had a $70 billion profit became 22 percent of the citys revenue. Another estimate (in 2006) was that the financial services industry makes up 9% of the citys work force and 31% of the tax base. An additional estimate (2007) from Steve Malanga of the Manhattan Institute was that the securities industry accounts for 4.7 percent of the jobs in New York City but 20.7 percent of its wages, and he estimated there were 175,000 securities-industries jobs in New York (both Wall Street area and midtown) paying an average of $350,000 annually. Between 1995 and 2005, the sector grew at an annual rate of about 6.6% annually, a respectable rate, but that other financial centers were growing faster. Another estimate (2008) was that Wall Street provided a fourth of all personal income earned in the city, and 10% of New York Citys tax revenue.  The citys securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the citys financial sector and an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the citys tax revenue, and 22 percent of the citys total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more percentage does the financial services industry make of tax base make than the city's work?",
