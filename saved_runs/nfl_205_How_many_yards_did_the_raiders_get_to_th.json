    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn November 19, the Chiefs began a short week by facing their historic division rivals, the Oakland Raiders, and prepared for another home game just four days later against the Denver Broncos.  The game was broadcast on CBS at noon Kansas City time. Tight end Tony Gonzalez missed the game because of a sprained shoulder from week 10, and at the time his status for the Thanksgiving game was unknown.  Brian Waters and Kevin Sampson will also miss the game, and Derrick Johnson and Greg Wesley are questionable to start. In the week before the game, Trent Green was cleared by his doctor to play in the game.  Coach Herm Edwards said early Wednesday (November 15) that whatever decision he made would remain a secret until game time,  but by the evening, Fox Sports reported Edwards confirmed Green to be the.  On the Chiefs' radio broadcast, Mitch Holthus noted the crowd was so deafening that it sounded \"like a playoff game.\" Trent Green took the field for the first time in two months, but barely threw the ball in the first half, gaining only 3-yards passing.  Green was not making many throws for the first 3&#189; quarters.  He attempted four passes in the first half for only three yards.  Edwards said he dialed down the playbook not necessarily because of Green's rust but because the Chiefs wanted to get Larry Johnson more involved.  With the help of backup Michael Bennett, Larry Johnson and the run game trampled the Raiders to get into the end zone from 5&#160;yards out.  The Chiefs led 7-0. The noise from the Chiefs fans began to die down when the Raiders took the lead.  After offensive struggles from both teams, the Chiefs finally managed to be within 15-yards until they were penalized for delay of game, setting them back 5&#160;yards.  The Chiefs managed to kick a field goal to make the game 13-10, reclaiming the lead.  Through the fourth quarter, the Raiders were plagued with multiple penalties.  Trent Green made his biggest throw of the game when he connected with Eddie Kennison for a 24-yard gain, and another to Samie Parker for 16&#160;yards.  Larry Johnson capped off the offensive drive by running 9-yards into the endzone.  The play was challenged by Oakland and reversed, but the Chiefs still managed to score with a 1-yard touchdown by Johnson with less than 2&#160;minutes to go in the game.  After an PAT, the Chiefs secured their lead 17-13. Aaron Brooks shot a pass from the 8&#160;yard line to Randy Moss, but the ball was intercepted by rookie safety Jarrad Page with 30&#160;seconds left in the game.  The Chiefs secured the win with a kneel-down by Trent Green, and their seventh straight win over the Raiders, their 50th win over the Raiders in 95 meetings.  The game marked the first time in 120 games,  since 1999, that Tony Gonzalez did not play in the game. Larry Johnson finished with a two-touchdown, 159-yard rushing game on his 27th birthday.  Trent Green in his comeback performance finished with 9 completed passes out of 16 attempts for 102&#160;yards passing.  Aaron Brooks had his own impressive comeback by completing 13 or 22 passes for 179&#160;yards passing and one touchdown.  The Chiefs finished the game with only 92&#160;yards passing, but 200 rushing.  The Raiders were penalized 8 times for 65&#160;yards.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did the raiders get to the end zone?",
