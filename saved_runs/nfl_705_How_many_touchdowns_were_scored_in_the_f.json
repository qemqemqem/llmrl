    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game skid, the Saints played their Week 3 Monday night homeopener, as they played an interconference duel with the Tennessee Titans.  In the first quarter, New Orleans' struggles continued as Titans kicker Rob Bironas nailed a 33-yard field goal, while QB Vince Young completed a 35-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Jones.  In the second quarter, the Saints managed to get the only score of the period as RB Reggie Bush got a 1-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, New Orleans took the lead with Bush getting another 1-yard TD run.  However, Tennessee regained the lead with RB LenDale White's 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Titans took over as Young completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Bo Scaife, while DB Vincent Fuller ended the game with an interception return of 61 yards for a touchdown.  In the game, QB Drew Brees was 29 of 45 for 225 yards with 4 interceptions (3 of them coming from LB Keith Bulluck). With the loss, the Saints entered their Bye Week at 0-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were scored in the first half?",
