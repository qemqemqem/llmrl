    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their road win over the Steelers, the Bengals flew to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for a Week 11 duel with the Oakland Raiders. In the first quarter, the Bengals have the early lead as QB Carson Palmer scrambled 1 yard to the end zone for a touchdown. In the second quarter Palmer again made a 1-yard touchdown run. The Oakland would reply with QB Bruce Gradkowski making a 10-yard touchdown pass to TE Zach Miller, and kicker Sebastian Janikowski hitting a 52-yard field goal in the third quarter. To rap up the third quarter kicker Shayne Graham made a 25-yard field goal for the Bengals. In the fourth quarter Oakland rallied as Gradkowski hooked up with WR Louis Murphy on 29-yard touchdown pass to tie the game and eventually the Raiders pulled out the win as Sebastian Janikowski hit the game winning 33-yard field goal with 12 seconds left to give Cincinnati a loss.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
