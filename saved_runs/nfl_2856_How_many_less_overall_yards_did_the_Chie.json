Kansas City took an early lead on a Smith to Travis Kelce touchdown pass, but Colin Kaepernick hit Stevie Johnson with a TD pass just before halftime for a 13-10 lead. Smith struck again in the third quarter with a 17-yard scoring pass to De'Anthony Thomas, but Dawson hit three more field goals to give the Niners the win. The Niners outgained the Chiefs 357-264, and had a 36:04-23:56 time of possession advantage, but they only scored one touchdown in four trips into the red zone, continuing their season-long problem in that area.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many less overall yards did the Chiefs have?",
