In the 1st quarter they got off to a fast start as Mike Wallace and Ryan Tannehill connected on an 18-yard TD pass for a 7-0 lead.  The Colts got on the board as Adam Vinatieri nailed a 30-yard field goal for a 7-3 score.  The Phins then increased their lead as Lamar Miller ran for a 10-yard TD making the score 14-3.  The Colts would score in the 2nd quarter as Andrew Luck found Coby Fleener on a 3-yard TD pass shortening the lead to 4, 14-10.  They eventually grabbed the lead as Ahmad Bradshaw ran for a 1-yard TD, 17-14.  Caleb Sturgis of the Phins tied it up before halftime with a 54-yard field goal, 17-17.  In the 3rd quarter, the Colts retook the lead as Vinatieri nailed a 38-yard field goal for a 20-17 game.  The Phins then retook the lead as Charles Clay ran for a 1-yard TD for a 24-20 game. The Phins then held the Colts scoreless in the 4th quarter and vice versa which eventually gave the team the win as they improved to 2-0 on the season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total points were scored in the game?",
