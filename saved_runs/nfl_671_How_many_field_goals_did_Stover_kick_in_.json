    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill in the hunt for their first win of the year, the Dolphins went home for a Week 15 intraconference duel with the Baltimore Ravens.  In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Ravens kicker Matt Stover managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Dolphins continued to trail as Stover kicked a 39-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the 'Fins got on the board as kicker Jay Feely managed to get a 23-yard field goal.  Baltimore would end the half with QB Kyle Boller completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, Miami began to gain steam as RB Samkon Gado managed to get a 7-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Dolphins took the lead as Feely kicked a 29-yard and an 18-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Ravens tied the game with Stover nailing an 18-yard field goal.  In overtime, the Dolphins nearly lost again as Stover missed a potential game winning 44 yard field goal. However, the demons were lifted as QB Cleo Lemon completed the game-winning 64-yard TD pass to WR Greg Camarillo. Soon after players and coaches rejoiced in the locker room after a long-awaited first win. With the win, not only did Miami improve to 1-13, but it also snapped a 16-game losing streak dating back to last season's December 10 win over the New England Patriots, notching their first win of the 2007 season and avoiding their becoming the first team in NFL history to go 0-16. This was their only win in a 1-15 and would keep them from being possibly labeled as the worst team in NFL history. They also avoided having to play with a 0-14 record against a New England Patriots team carrying the complementary 14-0 record, and widely rooted for to become the first team in over 30 years to match the perfect season feat originally posted by the Dolphins. Cleo Lemon got his first career 300-yard game, as he completed 23 out of 39 passes for 315 yards and 1 touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Stover kick in the first half?",
