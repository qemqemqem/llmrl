    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe 5th Light Infantry was a long established regiment in the Indian Army, dating from 1803. and had a good military record. It was initially known as the 2nd Battalion, 21st Bengal Native Infantry and was re-designated as the 42nd Bengal Native  Infantry in 1843. After the Indian Mutiny, also known as the Indian rebellion of 1857, the surviving Bengal regiments were renumbered in 1861 and consequently the 42nd became the 5th Bengal Native  Infantry. Following army reforms, the word \u2018'Native'' was dropped the regiment simply became known as the 5th Light Infantry. The regiment was well known for several battle honors, which included the Arakan, Afghanistan and Kandahar 1842, Ghunze 1842, Kabul and Moodkee, Ferozeshah and Sobroan 1857. It also fought in the Second Afghan War of 1879-80 and the Third Burmese War of 1885-87, which led to the British annexation of Burma and its tributary Shan states. Immediately prior to World War One, the regiment was employed in garrison duties in India. In 1914 the 5th LI was stationed in Nowgong when it was posted to Singapore to replace the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, which had been ordered to France. Unusually for 1914-15 the 5th Light Infantry was an entirely Muslim unit, mainly comprising Ranghars  and Pathans, commanded by British and Indian officers. Upon arrival in Singapore, the 5th Light Infantry was based in Alexandra Barracks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did the Second Afghan War last?",
