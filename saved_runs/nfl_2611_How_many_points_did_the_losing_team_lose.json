    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Dolphins started their 2013 season on the road against the Browns.  They would score first in the 1st quarter as Caleb Sturgis kicked a 45-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  They led 6-0 in the 2nd quarter after Sturgis kicked a 49-yard field goal.  The Browns got on the board and took the lead before halftime as Brandon Weeden found Jordan Cameron on a 7-yard pass for a 7-6 score.  After the break, the Phins went back to work and took the lead as Ryan Tannehill found Brian Hartline for a 34-yard pass and retook the lead 13-7.  The Browns then came within 3 as Billy Cundiff kicked a 39-yard field goal shortening the lead to 13-10.  In the 4th quarter it was all Dolphins and Daniel Thomas ran for a 1-yard TD making the score 20-10 while Sturgis kicked a 36-yard field goal for the final score of the game 23-10.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the losing team lose the game by?",

Therefore, the losing team (Browns) lost by 13 points (23-10).",
