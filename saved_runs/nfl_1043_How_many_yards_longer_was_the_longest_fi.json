    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill trying to get their first win of the season, the Lions traveled to Soldier Field for a Week 9 NFC North rematch with the Chicago Bears.  In the first quarter, Detroit trailed early as Bears kicker Robbie Gould got a 36-yard field goal, along with QB Kyle Orton getting a 5-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Lions greatly responded with rookie RB Kevin Smith getting a 1-yard TD run (with a blocked PAT), along with QB Dan Orlovsky completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson and a 14-yard TD pass to WR Shaun McDonald.  Chicago would respond with Gould getting a 41-yard field goal, yet Detroit answered with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 52-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bears began to rally as QB Rex Grossman (who took over for Orton after he left the game in the second quarter with a right foot sprain) completed a 6-yard TD pass to WR Rashied Davis.  In the fourth quarter, Chicago completed their rally as Grossman got a 1-yard TD run.  The Lions tried to rally, but the Bears' defense prevented any possible comeback from happening. With their ninth consecutive road loss, not only did the Lions fall to 0-8, but following the Bengals' victory over the Jaguars, the Lions remained the only winless NFL team.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was the longest field goal over the shortest field goal?",
