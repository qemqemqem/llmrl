The game turned out to be a disaster for the Browns as Brady and the Pats stormed the Browns defense, dropping the Browns to 0-5. This was the second consecutive season a team started 0-5, after the 2015 Detroit Lions. This is the team's first start with such a record since 2012. It is also the team's eighth straight loss, dating back to the 2015 season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many gaves have the Lions lost in a row?",
