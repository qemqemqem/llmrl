    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their home win over the Broncos, the Panthers flew to Giants Stadium for a crucial Week 16 battle with the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants, where the winner would lock up the NFC's #1 seed. This was also Carolina's second appearance on NBC's Sunday Night Football. Despite trailing early in the first quarter through Giants kicker John Carney's 32-yard field goal, Carolina would respond with running back DeAngelo Williams' 13-yard touchdown run.  New York would regain the lead in the second quarter with running back Brandon Jacobs getting a 2-yard touchdown run, yet the Panthers answered right back with Williams getting a 5-yard and a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Giants would close out the first half with Carney nailing a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New York was gaining ground with quarterback Eli Manning completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kevin Boss.  Carolina would reply in the fourth quarter with Williams getting a 30-yard touchdown run.  However, the Giants would tie the game with Jacobs getting a 1-yard touchdown run (followed by Manning's 2-point conversion pass to wide receiver Domenik Hixon).  The Panthers would get a late-game drive going and tried to end the game with kicker John Kasay, but his 50-yard attempt sailed wide left.  In overtime, New York would take their second possession and end the game with Jacobs' 2-yard touchdown run. Despite falling to 11-4, Carolina would get a playoff berth, due in part to the Cowboys losing to the Ravens.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest touchdown play of the game?",
