    "problem_text": "Context:\nToward the end of his third term as Mayor of Jacksonville, Martin announced he would not seek re-election and instead declared his candidacy for 1924 Florida gubernatorial election. In the Democratic Party (United States) on June 3, Martin defeated former Governor Sidney Johnston Catts, Frank E. Jennings, Worth W. Trammell (brother of Senator and former Governor Park Trammell), and Charles H. Spencer. There were 55,715 votes for Martin, 43,230 votes for Catts, 37,962 votes for Jennings, 8,381 votes for Trammell, and 1,408 votes for Spencer. Because no candidate received a majority, the second choice of Jennings, Trammell, and Spencer voters were added to the totals for Martin and Catts. Martin won with 73,054 votes versus 49,297 votes for Catts. With the Democratic primary then being tantamount to election, Martin won the general election. He defeated Republican Party (United States) William R. ONeal by a vote of 84,181 to 17,499, a margin of 65.58%.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more votes did Martin won the general election over ONeal?",
