To solve the problem, I first identified the total production of South Korea's automobile industry in 1988, which was 1.1 million units.

The difference between these two numbers is 0.2 million units, which is the increase in total production from 1988 to 1989.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have double-checked my calculations and made sure that I was interpreting the data correctly.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe automobile industry was one of South Koreas major growth and export industries in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, the capacity of the South Korean motor industry had increased more than fivefold since 1984; it exceeded 1 million units in 1988. Total investment in car and car-component manufacturing was over US$3 billion in 1989. Total production (including buses and trucks) for 1988 totaled 1.1 million units, a 10.6 percent increase over 1987, and grew to an estimated 1.3 million vehicles (predominantly passenger cars) in 1989. Almost 263,000 passenger cars were produced in 1985, a figure that grew to approximately 846,000 units in 1989. In 1988 automobile exports totaled 576,134 units, of which 480,119 units (83.3 percent) were sent to the United States. Throughout most of the late 1980s, much of the growth of South Koreas automobile industry was the result of a surge in exports; 1989 exports, however, declined 28.5 percent from 1988. This decline reflected sluggish car sales to the United States, especially at the less expensive end of the market, and labor strife at home. South Korea today has developed into one of the worlds List of countries by motor vehicle production. The Hyundai Kia Automotive Group is South Koreas largest automaker in terms of revenue, production units and worldwide presence.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many millions had total production increased in South Korean from 1988 to 1989?",
