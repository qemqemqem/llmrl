Following the loss to the Titans Rex Ryan announced that Greg McElroy would start for the Jets against the Chargers.  Following a 63-yard Michael Spurlock punt return touchdown McElroy led back to back scoring drives ending in 1-yard Shonn Greene touchdowns.  The Chargers took over the game in the third quarter with two Philip Rivers touchdowns and a Nick Novak field goal while McElroy was intercepted once and strip-sacked once. With the loss, the Jets fell to 6-9, their first losing season since 2007.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the jets fall?",
