With that in mind, Dallass violent crime rate (12.06 per 1,000 people) is lower than St Louis (24.81), Detroit (24.22), Baltimore (16.96), Philadelphia (15.62), Cleveland (15.47), Miami (15.09), Washington, D.C.. (14.48), Kansas City, Missouri (14.44) and Boston (13.39). However, Houston (11.69), Los Angeles (7.87), and New York City (6.38) have lower violent crime rates than Dallas.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more crime rate points did Baltimore have than Los Angeles?",
