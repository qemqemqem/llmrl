This is between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed world with 5 and 50 per 100,000 people newly developing the condition each year. Onset is most frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. In 2013, it resulted in 38,000 deaths up from 28,000 deaths in 1990. The first recognized description of RA was made in 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landr\u00e9-Beauvais (1772-1840) of Paris. The term rheumatoid arthritis is based on the Greek for watery and inflamed joints.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years old was Dr. Augustin Jacob Landr\u00e9-Beauvais when he first recognized the description of RA?",
