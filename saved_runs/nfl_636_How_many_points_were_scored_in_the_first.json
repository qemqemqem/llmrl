    "problem_text": "Context:\nGame SummaryComing off of their home win against Kansas City, from just 4 days previous, the Colts traveled to Atlanta for a Thanksgiving game against Falcons. Colts rookie wide receiver Anthony Gonzalez returned to the lineup from an injury and he proved to be very beneficial for the Colts, he finished with 105&#160;yards on 6 catches. The Falcons jumped out to an early 10-0 lead with a Morten Andersen field goal and touchdown pass to Roddy White. However, the Colts would respond with a touchdown pass of their own to Reggie Wayne cutting the Atlanta lead to only three early in the second quarter. They would then take the lead on a touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark. They would add another touchdown before the half and took a 21-13 lead into halftime. In the second half the Colts would cruise to victory by adding a Joseph Addai rushing touchdown and Adam Vinatieri field goal to make the final score 31-13. With the victory the Colts moved to 9-2 and still in command of the AFC South. The Colts had 11 days off until next week's big divisional showdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars with 1st place in the division on the line. The Colts are 13-1 in their history against the Falcons. Wayne (5 receptions for 66&#160;yards and 1 TD) was given NFL Network's inaugural Pudding Pie Award for his efforts.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points were scored in the first half of the game?",
