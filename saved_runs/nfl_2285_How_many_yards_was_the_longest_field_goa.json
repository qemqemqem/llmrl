Pittsburgh trailed late in the first quarter when Texans quarterback Matt Schaub completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels.  Houston would add onto their lead in the second quarter with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 25-yard field goal. The Steelers finally answered in the third quarter with a 3-yard touchdown run from running back Rashard Mendenhall. Pittsburgh would tie the game in the fourth quarter with a 26-yard field goal from kicker Shaun Suisham, but the Texans retook the lead when running back Arian Foster got a 42-yard touchdown run. The Steelers were unable to rally, and Big Ben was intercepted on the Steelers' final drive.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
