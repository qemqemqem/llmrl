    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn the 2004-05 season Bj\u00f8rndalen was the 16th best shot with an 85% success rate, the second best Norwegian behind Egil Gjelland. He hit 331 targets out of a possible 364. His prone like most biathletes was much better than his standing shoot, he hit 169/180 (92%) in the prone and 163/184 (81%) in the standing. He had an average of 88% in the individual, sprint and relay, a 91% hit rate in the mass start but only 79% in the pursuit. During his career in 1999/00 he averaged 82%, in 2000-01 78%, 2001-02 74%, 2002-03 86% and in 2003-04 he hit 80% of the targets, however in those five years his standing shoot was the same or better than his prone shoot. In comparison, his greatest rival Rapha\u00ebl Poir\u00e9e averaged 87% in 2004-05 and 86% in 2005-06. Nikolay Kruglov was the best shot in 2004-05 with a 91% success rate, with Ricco Gro\u00df in second with 89%, and in 2005 Julien Robert was best with a 93% average and Gro\u00df again second with 91%.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percentage points was Bj\u00f8rndalen behind the best shot in 2004-05?",
