From my research, I found that Henry had two previous French endeavors that proved less than successful. Therefore, the answer to the problem is 2.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have looked for more information about Henry's French endeavors, such as the reasons for their failure and the specific battles or campaigns involved.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn 1525 Henry VIII of England wanted to mount an invasion of France  since the King of France, Francis I, had been captured by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. Henry required additional funds of \u00a3800,000, so to gain said money Wolsey resorted to the Amicable Grant. The English Parliament was at this time unlikely to support war, since it was proving to be expensive. Furthermore, Henry's previous French endeavours, which had occurred in 1522 and 1523, had proved less than successful.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many previous French endeavours did Henry have that proved less than successful?",
