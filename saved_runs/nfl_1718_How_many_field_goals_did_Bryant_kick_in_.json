    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their divisional win over the Buccaneers, the Falcons stayed at home, donned their throwback uniforms, and played their Week 10 interconference duel with the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday night.  After a scoreless first quarter, Atlanta delivered the opening punch in the second quarter as quarterback Matt Ryan found running back Jason Snelling on a 28-yard touchdown run, followed by a 28-yard field goal from kicker Matt Bryant. The Falcons added onto their lead in the third quarter as a Brent Grimes interception set up Bryant booted a 51-yard field goal.  The Ravens would answer with quarterback Joe Flacco completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Anquan Boldin.  Atlanta struck back in the fourth quarter as Ryan found wide receiver Roddy White on a 4-yard touchdown pass.  Baltimore took the lead as Flacco completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Derrick Mason, followed by a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Todd Heap, with 1:05 left. However, a 24-yard completion to Michael Jenkins and Ravens penalties set the Falcons up at the Ravens 33-yard line. Then, Ryan connected with White again on a 33-yard touchdown pass (with a failed two-point conversion) with 20 seconds left in the game, giving the Falcons a 26-21 lead. Flacco attempted a miracle win, but his last pass to T.J. Houshmendazeh was fumbled with 0:02 seconds left. During halftime, Deion Sanders was inducted into the Falcons Ring of Honor.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Bryant kick in the third quarter?",
