    "problem_text": "Context:\nNeeding a win to secure their first playoff berth since 2002, the Browns flew to Paul Brown Stadium for Round 2 of the Battle of Ohio with the Cincinnati Bengals. After a scoreless first quarter, Cleveland trailed in the second quarter as Bengals kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 29-yard and a 38-yard field goal, along with QB Carson Palmer completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and RB Kenny Watson getting a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Browns began to rally as QB Derek Anderson completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland drew closer as Anderson and Edwards hooked up with each other again on a 5-yard TD pass. Late in the game, the Browns tried to take the lead, but Cincinnati's early lead was too much to overcome. Despite the loss, Braylon Edwards set the Browns' single-season record for the most touchdown receptions with 15. Also, with TE Kellen Winslow reaching 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career, Edwards & Winslow became the franchise's first receiving duo to get 1,000&#160;yards in the same year.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards were gained by touchdown pass by either team?",
