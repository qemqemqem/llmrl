    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I subtracted the number of families from the number of households in the Quad Cities metropolitan area. The number of households was not given directly, but it can be calculated by multiplying the population density by the area of the metropolitan area. Then, I multiplied the number of households by the percentage of households in the city to get the number of households in the metropolitan area. Finally, I subtracted the number of families from the number of households to get the answer of 14,320.\n\nTo solve the problem better, it would have been helpful to have the actual number of households and families in the Quad Cities metropolitan area, rather than having to calculate them from other information. Additionally, having more information about the percentage of households and families in the metropolitan area versus the city would have made the calculation more accurate.",

As of the 2000 census, there were 98,359 people, 39,124 households, and 24,804 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,566.5 people per square mile (604.8/km\u00b2). There were 41,350 housing units at an average density of 658.5 per square mile (254.3/km\u00b2). Davenports population density is 30 times the average density of Iowa and 20 times the average density of the United States. However, it is about a third less than Des Moines and 20 percent less than Cedar Rapids, the only two cities in Iowa with higher populations than Davenport. Sioux City, the next city smaller than Davenport in population, has a density of 5 people more per square mile.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more households residing in Quad Cities metropolitan area than families?",
