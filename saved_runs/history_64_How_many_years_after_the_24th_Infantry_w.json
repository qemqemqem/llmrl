The regiment served in the Iraq War from 2004 to 2005, and was decorated for its service. In 2006, during a re-organization of the Army, the regiment was re-flagged; however, the 1st Battalion was not included, and so it alone retains the regimental designation and carries on its legacy. It is now part of the 1st Brigade Combat Team , 25th Infantry Division at Fort Wainwright, Alaska.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after the 24th Infantry was re-instituted did it finish serving in the Iraq War?",
