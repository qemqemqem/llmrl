The Chargers were up in the fourth quarter 24-13 before the Bengals scored a TD with a 2-point conversion and a field goal tying the game. The Chargers won in the end with a 52-yard field goal by Nate Kaeding. The close win put the Chargers at 11-3. It marked their 9th straight win and 17th straight win in December. With this win and a 20-19 loss by Denver to Oakland, the Chargers clinched the AFC.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points were the Chargers ahead by at the end of the first half?",
