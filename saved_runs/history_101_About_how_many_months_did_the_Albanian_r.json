    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe main headquarters of the rebels were in Podgorica and King Nikola provided weapons for the insurgents. King Nicholas promissed to support Malissori with arms and to provide a shelter to their families before the revolt began. Although both king Nikola and prince Danilo were assuring Ottoman ambassador that they are observing \"the strictest neutrality\" it was obvious that Kingdom of Montenegro was involved in this revolt. General Vukoti\u0107 organized passing out the weapon to the rebels. The fighting of the Malisori tribes was directed by Vukoti\u0107. Nikola's strategy was to stimulate unrest in northern Albania and north-western Kosovo to the point where he could intervene and annex more territory for Montenegro. Most of contemporary studies confirm that this uprising was supported by Montenegro. During Albanian Revolt of 1910 many Albanian refugees found shelter in Montenegro. They were a heavy burden for Montenegro whose souvereign stated that Montenegro spent more than its annual budget to support the Albanian refugees. At the end of March 1911 Kingdom of Montenegro forced them to return to Kosovo Vilayet. Thousands of refugees together with the Albanian Catholic tribes staged the Albanian Revolt of 1911. The Albanian National Committee was founded in Podgorica in February 1911. In a meeting of the Committee held in Podgorica from 2 to 4 February 1911, under the leadership of Nikolla bey Ivanaj and Sokol Baci Ivezaj, it was decided to organize an Albanian uprising.\n\nQuestion:\nAbout how many months did the Albanian refugees stay in Montenegro before they were forced to return to Kosovo Vilayet?",
