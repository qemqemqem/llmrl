To find the number of parishes that did not exceed more than 25%, we need to subtract the number of parishes that exceeded 25% from the total number of parishes. From the table, we know that the total number of civil parishes in Scotland is 871, and the number of parishes that exceeded 25% is 14. Therefore, the number of parishes that did not exceed more than 25% is 871 - 14 = 857. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I should have read the question more carefully and double-checked my answer before submitting it.

In addition, no civil parish on mainland Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 20% (the highest value is in Ardnamurchan, Highland (council area), with 19.3%). Out of a total of 871 civil parishes in Scotland, the proportion of Gaelic speakers exceeds 50% in 7 parishes, exceeds 25% in 14 parishes, and exceeds 10% in 35 parishes. Decline in traditional areas has recently been balanced by growth in the Scottish Lowlands. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the number of Gaelic speakers rose in nineteen of the countrys 32 council areas. The largest absolute gains were in Aberdeenshire (council area) (+526), North Lanarkshire (+305), City of Aberdeen (+216), and East Ayrshire (+208). The largest relative gains were in Aberdeenshire (+0.19%), East Ayrshire (+0.18%), Moray (+0.16%), and Orkney Islands (+0.13%).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many parishes total did not exceed more than 25%?",
