    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I calculated the percentage reduction in corporate income tax for each year from 2006 to 2008 and then added them up to get the total percentage reduction. The percentage reduction in corporate income tax for each year is as follows: \n\n- From 17% to 14% is a reduction of 3/17 = 0.1765 or 17.65%\n- From 14% to 13% is a reduction of 1/14 = 0.0714 or 7.14%\n- From 13% to 12% is a reduction of 1/13 = 0.0769 or 7.69%\n\nAdding these percentage reductions gives a total reduction of 17.65% + 7.14% + 7.69% = 32.48%, which is equivalent to a reduction of 5% (rounded to the nearest whole number).\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have used a formula for calculating the total percentage change between two values, which is:\n\nTotal percentage change = ((new value - old value) / old value) x 100%\n\nIn this case, the old value is 17%, and the new value is 12%, so the total percentage",
