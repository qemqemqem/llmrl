    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns, coming off a close victory over the Panthers, headed to Sun Life Stadium for their Week 13 battle against the Miami Dolphins. After a scoreless first quarter, the Browns scored first on a Phil Dawson 32-yard field goal. The Dolphins tied it at the half with Dan Carpenter hitting a 60-yard field goal, the longest in franchise history. In the second half, Benjamin Watson gave the Browns a 10-3 lead with a 3-yard touchdown reception from Jake Delhomme. The Dolphins responded with Chad Henne driving Miami down the field and tying the game with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Fasano. Late in the fourth quarter, Mike Adams intercepted Henne's pass and returned it to the 2. The Browns bled out the clock, and Dawson hit the game-winning field goal as time expired, giving the Browns a 13-10 victory. With the win, the Browns improved to 5-7, matching their win total from the 2009 season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Browns have at halftime?",
