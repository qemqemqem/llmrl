    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Dallas Cowboys returned home to Texas Stadium to take on the 0-3 St. Louis Rams. Both teams remained scoreless in the 1st quarter. Also, starting cornerback Anthony Henry left with a sprained right ankle late in the first quarter. He'd return to the sidelines later in the game after x-rays were negative, but would not return to game. Early in the 2nd quarter, the Rams' Jeff Wilkins attempted a 28-yard field goal and missed. On the next possession, the Cowboys would cap an 80-yard drive down the field with a hand-off to Julius Jones for 2 yards and the first touchdown of the game. On the next Dallas possession, the Cowboys would punt after failing to convert on a 3rd down. Mat McBriar punt went 56 yards to the St. Louis 15 and Dante Hall returned it 86 yards for a Rams TD, tying the game. Late in the 2nd quarter, Tony Romo turned a bad snap from center Andre Gurode, 33-yards behind the line of scrimmage, into a 4-yard gain for a 3rd-down conversion. It kept the drive alive and enabled the Cowboys to regain the lead with 11 seconds left before halftime when Romo again ran with the ball for 15 yards and the second Cowboy touchdown of the game. In the second half, the Cowboys scored three more times as Romo connected twice with Patrick Crayton for 59- and 37-yard TDs, and with Jason Witten for a 17-yard TD. The Rams would get another chance to score, but QB Marc Bulger (playing with two broken ribs) would throw an interception in the end zone to Dallas' Ken Hamlin. Gus Frerotte would come in for Bulger in the 3rd quarter. The 35-7 victory marked the Cowboys' first 4-0 start since 1995, and left the Rams 0-4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total points were scored in the game?",
