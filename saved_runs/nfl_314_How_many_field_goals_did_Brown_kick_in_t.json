The Eagles trailed early, as Texans QB David Carr completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR Eric Moulds.  The Eagles would respond in the second quarter as QB Donovan McNabb completed a 42-yard TD pass to WR Donte' Stallworth.  Even though Texans kicker Kris Brown would make a 34-yard field goal, the Eagles would take the lead for good as McNabb completed a 5-yard pass to WR Reggie Brown.  In the second half, Philadelphia would wrap up the win with a 31-yard TD pass to RB Brian Westbrook in the third quarter and Kicker David Akers making a 42-yard field goal in the fourth quarter.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Brown kick in the second quarter?",
