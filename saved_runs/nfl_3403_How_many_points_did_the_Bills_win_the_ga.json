    "problem_text": "Context:\n Traveling to Buffalo to face the Bills, the Raiders were without running back Marshawn Lynch, who was suspended for one game after making contact with an official during the team's win against Kansas City the week before. Hoping to build on the victory over the Chiefs, the Raiders started well driving 81 yards as Jamize Olawale scored from one yard out to give Oakland a 7-0 lead. However, the Raider offense sputtered on their next two possession and were forced to punt. After Tyrod Taylor hit former Raider Andre Holmes for six-yard touchdown pass to tie the game, the Raiders took over with just over two minutes remaining in the first half. Derek Carr hit DeAndr&#233; Washington over the middle over a five-yard gain, but was hit by Leonard Johnson and fumbled the ball which was recovered by Matt Milano and returned for a 40-yard touchdown to give the Bills a 14-7 lead at the half. The Bills increased the lead on their first possession of the third quarter with a 35-yard field goal. Carr was intercepted on the next Raider possession and the Bills added another field goal to push the lead to 20-7 with more than 10 minutes left in the third quarter. The Raider offense continued to struggle and punted on their next possession. The Bills took advantage and moved 80 yards in a 7:19 drive before Taylor snuck the ball in from inside the one-yard line on the first play of the fourth quarter to move the Buffalo lead to 27-7. The Raider offense finally came to life on their next possession, going no-huddle and moving 75 yards on nine plays before Carr hit Washington from four yards out to the narrow the lead to 27-14. After forcing a Buffalo punt, the Raider offense stalled near midfield and turned the ball over on downs. Looking to take some time off the clock, the Bills instead put the game out of reach as LeSean McCoy scored on a 48-yard run on the first play of the drive to move the lead to 34-14. The Raiders were able to move into Buffalo territory with under two minutes remaining, but Carr was intercepted as the Bills were able to run out the clock. The loss moved the Raider to 3-5 on the season. The fifth loss on the season, in Week 8, surpassed the number of losses (four) the Raiders suffered in the entire season the previous year. The Raider defense struggled once again, giving up 166 yards on the ground to the Bills, but did limit the Bills to 165 yards through the air. Carr completed 31 of 49 passes for 313 yards, but his two interceptions and two fumbles by the Raiders were their undoing.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Bills win the game by?",
