In the first quarter, Buffalo drew first blood as RB Marshawn Lynch got an 11-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Jaguars responded with kicker Josh Scobee getting a 28-yard field goal.  The Bills closed the half with kicker Rian Lindell's a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Jacksonville took the lead with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run and Scobee getting a 50-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars increased their lead with Scobee nailing a 39-yard field goal. Buffalo rallied as QB Trent Edwards completed a 7-yard TD pass to rookie WR James Hardy, along with Lindell's yard field goal. With yet another win, the Bills improved to their first 2-0 start since 2003.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many TD runs did Maurice Jones-Drew have in the game?",
