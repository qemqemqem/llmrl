    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Bengals week 14 game saw the 2-10 Raiders visiting Paul Brown Stadium. Chris Henry put the Bengals on the board first, on an 8-yard pass from Carson Palmer. Later in the first quarter, Rudi Johnson scored on a 9-yard run. In the second quarter, Sebastian Janikowski converted a 33-yard field goal attempt. The Bengals struck two more times in the third quarter on 6-yard Rudi Johnson run, and a 20-yard strike from Palmer to Houshmandzadeh. The lone Raider touchdown was scored on an Aaron Brooks-to-Ronald Curry 6-yard pass in the fourth quarter. The Bengal defensive kept the Raiders offense from threatening much of the game, allowing only 45 yards rushing. Even though quarterback Carson Palmer threw 3 interceptions (two to Nnamdi Asomugha and one to Fabian Washington), and running back Rudi Johnson turned the ball over in the second quarter, the 4 turnovers given to the Raiders were not enough opportunities for the Oakland offense to create points. Bengal mistakes were systemic, as even kicker Shayne Graham missed an extra point, bouncing the ball off the left upright in the third quarter. Cincinnati was not forced to punt once during this game. For the first time in Bengals' history, four players were over 100 yards in offensive production (Palmer, Houshmandzadeh, Chad Johnson and Rudi Johnson). The fourth straight win improved the Bengals' record to 8-5, and put them into wild card contention.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards of touchdowns did Carson Palmer have?",
