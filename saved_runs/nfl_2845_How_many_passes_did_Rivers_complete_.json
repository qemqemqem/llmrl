    "problem_text": "Context:\n Peyton Manning connected with Emmanuel Sanders for three touchdowns to lead the Denver Broncos to a 35-21 win over San Diego. Rookie Juwan Thompson also ran for two TDs to help the Broncos (6-1) expand their lead over the Chargers (5-3) in the AFC West. A year earlier, San Diego had handed Denver their only home loss of the season. The game was tied 7-7 in the second quarter after Rivers capped a 13-play, 84-yard drive with a 2-yard TD to Allen. On the following kickoff, the Chargers appeared to recover a fumble by Denver, but the play was overturned. Manning then drove his team eight plays for a 31-yard TD to Sanders past cornerback Richard Marshall. The Chargers were trailing 28-14 in the fourth quarter with the Broncos on the San Diego 2, when Weddle intercepted Manning; however, the play was nullified by a holding penalty against Gilchrist, and Thompson scored on a 1-yard run the next play. The Chargers followed with an eight-play, 80-yard TD drive in less than two minutes, with Gates scoring for the second time for a 35-21 game with &#8203;9&#160;1&#8260;2 minutes left. Weddle forced a Denver fumble on the first play of the following drive, but San Diego was unable to recover the ball. Denver kicker Brandon McManus missed a 53-yard attempt with six minutes remaining, and the Chargers received the ball with excellent field position. San Diego's drive ended with a Rahim Moore interception of a Rivers pass intended for Floyd at the Denver 4. Rivers ended the game 30 of 41 for 252 yards with three TDs and two interceptions. Gates become the team leader in career yards receiving after passing Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver Lance Alworth (9,584). Manning finished 25 of 35 for 286 yards with three TDs and no interceptions. The Chargers were playing without injured cornerbacks Flowers (concussion) and Steve Williams (groin); Verrett played despite a hurt shoulder injured during the Raiders game, but was unable to play after a few series in the second quarter.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many passes did Rivers complete?",
