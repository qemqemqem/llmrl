To solve the problem, I read through the given context and looked for the information about how long Conlan umpired in the National League. I then counted the number of years from 1941 to 1965, which gave me the answer of 25. However, I missed the fact that Conlan retired after the 1964 season and only worked as a substitute umpire for 17 games in 1965. Therefore, the correct answer is 24 years.

He also umpired in the playoff series to decide the NLs regular-season champions in 1951 National League tie-breaker series, 1959 National League tie-breaker series and 1962 National League tie-breaker series (some sources erroneously credit him with umpiring in the 1946 NL playoff as well). He was the home plate umpire when Gil Hodges hit four home runs on August 31, ; he also umpired in the April 30,  game in which Willie Mays hit four home runs. He retired after the 1964 season, but returned to work as a substitute umpire for 17 games in 1965.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did Conlan umpire in the National League?",
