    "problem_text": "Context:\nLooking to keep up their win streak, the Texans traveled to Dallas for the battle for the Governor's Cup against the Dallas Cowboys. The only score of the first half came from a 33-yard Dan Bailey field goal with 0:16 left in the 2nd quarter. Houston scored with 8:56 left in the 3rd on an Arian Foster 15 yard run, leading 7-3. Dallas answered back with a 43-yard pass from Romo to Williams for a touchdown. After both teams forced a 3 and out, Dallas scored again to lead 17-7 with 9:50 left in the 4th. Houston answered back with a 29-yard field goal from Bullock with 2:31 left to trail 10-17. Dallas was penalized for a delay of game following a Houston timeout which lead to 4th down and 16. Following the penalty, the Texans got the ball back before tying the game with 0:41 left in regulation. Following a timeout called by both teams, Bailey's 53 yard field goal was no good, sending the game into overtime. Houston received the ball first, but was forced to punt the ball back from the Dallas 48. Dallas won the game following a Dan Bailey 49 yard field goal. In a historic game between the two Texas teams, both the Texans and Cowboys boasted a winning record (3-1) for the first time while meeting. With the win, Dallas leads the regular season series 3-1. The only time the Texans beat the Cowboys during the regular season was during the 2002 season, which was also the franchise's first win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points were scored in the first half?",
