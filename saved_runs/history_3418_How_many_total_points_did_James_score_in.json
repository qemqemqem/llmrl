    "problem_text": "Context:\nDuring the 2015-16 NBA season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East. Jamess final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the 2016 NBA Playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the 2016 NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors season, who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3-1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including The Block (basketball) on Andre Iguodala, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the Cleveland sports curse and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3-1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total points did James score in games 5 and 6?",
