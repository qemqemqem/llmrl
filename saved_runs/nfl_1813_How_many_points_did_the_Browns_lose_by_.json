The Browns scored first on a touchdown pass from wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi to wide receiver Brian Robiskie. In the second quarter, the Ravens stormed back, with two field goals by Billy Cundiff and a touchdown pass from Joe Flacco to T. J. Houshmandzadeh. Phil Dawson hit a field goal late in the quarter to send the Browns into halftime down 13-10. The Browns opened the second half with a failed onside kick, which led to a Derrick Mason touchdown reception, and the Browns lost 20-10.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Browns lose by?",
