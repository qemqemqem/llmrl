    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Titans won their first game of the year, and Vince Young earned his first NFL win in a game against the Washington Redskins at FedExField. The Titans got on the board first as K Rob Bironas connected on a 32-yard field goal five minutes into the game.  The Skins responded with a 10-yard touchdown run by RB Clinton Portis.  On the first play of the second quarter, Skins QB Mark Brunell hit TE Chris Cooley with a 24-yard touchdown pass.  Titans K Bironas converted a 26-yard field goal, and Young hit WR Brandon Jones with a 3-yard touchdown near the end of the first half, to pull the Titans to within one going into halftime.  Titans RB Travis Henry rushed for a career-high 178 yards and scored on a 2-yard run in the third quarter.  On the Skins next possession, Titans FB Casey Cramer blocked a Derrick Frost punt out of the end zone for a safety.   Skins RB Portis ran for his second touchdown early in the fourth quarter, and Brunell hit WR Santana Moss for the two-point conversion to tie the game at 22.  Titans K Bironas kicked a field goal from 30 yards out with 5 minutes left to give them a 25-22 lead.  The Skins had one last chance but Brunell threw an interception to S Lamont Thompson to seal the deal for the Titans.  With the win, the Titans went into their bye week at 1-5.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player scored special teams points besides the kickers?",
