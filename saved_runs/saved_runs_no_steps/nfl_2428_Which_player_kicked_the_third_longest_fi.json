    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter the Bills punted on their opening drive, the Patriots drove 48 yards to the Bills 25 and Gostkowski was good on a 43-yard field goal. On the second play of the Bills next drive, Fitzpatrick was strip-sacked by Wilfork with Cunningham recovering at the Patriots 13. Three plays later, Ridley scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 10-0. The Bills responded by driving to the Patriots 23 and Lindell was good on a 41-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 10-3. This led to four straight touchdown drives before halftime. The Patriots responded by racing 83 yards in 8 plays with Woodhead scoring on a 15-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 17-3. The Bills answered right back, racing 80 yards in just 6 plays, scoring on a 14-yard run by Jackson, trimming the deficit to 17-10. The Patriots drove 82 yards in 6 plays, scoring on Brady's 12-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, upping the lead to 24-10. The Bills weren't done though, marching 75 yards in 11 plays, scoring on Fitzpatrick's two-yard touchdown pass to Chandler, bringing the deficit to 24-17 at halftime. The Patriots drove to the Bills 31, but on 3rd-and-5, Marcell Dareus and Kyle Williams sacked Brady for a 7-yard loss and the Patriots punted rather than attempt a 56-yard field goal. After a Bills punt, aided by an unnecessary roughness penalty bringing the ball to the Bills 39, the Patriots needed just four plays to go 39 yards, scoring on Brady's 18-yard screen pass to Woodhead, his first multi-touchdown game of his career, making the score 31-17. The Bills answered, though, marching 84 yards in 11 plays, with Jackson trimming the deficit to 31-24 on a 1-yard run. The Bills drove to the Patriots 13, but Jackson was stripped by McCourty at the 1 and Arrington recovered. The Patriots were forced to punt, and the Bills raced 55 yards in a minute-and-a-half, scoring on Fitzpatrick's 2-yard touchdown pass to Jones, trimming the deficit to just 34-31. Edelman returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards to the Patriots 32, and the Patriots drove to the Bills 9, but the Bills defense kept the Patriots out of the end zone, giving the Bills a chance down just 37-31. The Bills drove to the Patriots 15, but,  McCourty intercepted Fitzpatrick's next pass in the end zone with 0:23 seconds left, and the Patriots were able to run out the clock. With the win, the Patriots improved to 6-3 on the season and 11-0 against the Buffalo Bills at Gillette Stadium.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player kicked the third longest field goal?",
