    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their home loss to the Vikings, the Browns flew to Invesco Field at Mile High for a Week 2 duel with the Denver Broncos. After recovering a fumble on the opening kickoff, the Browns started with a short field but couldn't capitalize, settling for a 22-yard field goal by kicker Phil Dawson. Broncos quarterback Kyle Orton would complete a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Scheffler for the game's first touchdown, and after a 47-yard field goal by Cleveland, the game was 7-6 after the first quarter. However, Cleveland's offensive struggles continued. Meanwhile, in the second and third quarter, kicker Matt Prater gave Denver a 23-yard and a 38-yard field goal. Afterwards, in the fourth quarter, the Broncos took control with touchdown runs by Peyton Hillis and Correll Buckhalter.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did Denver receive in the last quarter?",
