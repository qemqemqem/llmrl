    "problem_text": "Context:\nRiding high from their two-straight road wins, the Saints returned home to the Louisiana Superdome for the first time since December 26, 2004 for a special Monday Night game against their fellow NFC South division rival, the Atlanta Falcons, in front of a jubilant sold-out crowd of 70,003 and ESPN's largest-ever audience, with about 10.8 million households viewing, at the time the second-largest cable audience in history (behind the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) debate between Al Gore and Ross Perot on CNN). On just the fourth overall play of the game, Safety Steve Gleason blocked a punt and DB Curtis Deloatch managed to land on the ball in the end zone for the Saints first score of the game.  Former Saints kicker Morten Andersen helped Atlanta get its only score of the game, from a 26-yard field goal.  From there, the Saints dominated the rest of the game.  For the final score of the first quarter, WR Devery Henderson ran 11 yards for a touchdown on a reverse.  Kicker John Carney would provide the scoring for the rest of the game, as he kicked two second-quarter field goals (a 37-yarder and a 51-yarder), and one third-quarter field goal (a 20-yarder) to essentially wrap up the game.  From there, the Saints defense continued to put pressure on Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, as they sacked him five times, while limiting the running duo of Vick and Dunn to just a combined total of 101 rushing yards.  With their dominating performance, the Saints would take the lead in the NFC South with a surprising 3-0 record. Green Day and U2 performed jointly on the field before the game, while the Goo Goo Dolls held a concert outside the Dome earlier in the evening.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were longer than 40-yards?",
