    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Ottoman incursions in Dalmatia escalated to the point where Venice was forced to sign a treaty with Vladislaus II of Hungary and Pope Alexander VI by which they pledged 140,000 ducats a year for the Kingdom of Hungary to actively defend its southern Croatian territories, which aided the defence of Venetian Dalmatia, signed after long negotiations on 13 May 1501. In 1501 Feriz Beg captured Durazzo in Venetian Albania. By the end of 1502, Venice and the Ottoman Empire agreed on an armistice. On 31 January 1503, Venice signed another treaty with Vladislaus II, having already paid 124,000 ducats through the previous treaty, to pay 30,000 ducats a year for the same purpose. In 1503, Turkish cavalry raids reached Venetian territory in Northern Italy, and Venice was forced to recognize the Ottoman gains, ending the war. The economy of the Venetian cities in Dalmatia was severely impacted by the Turkish occupation of the hinterland during this war.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many ducats will Venice had given Vladislaus II from a signed Treaty, 3000 a year and 124,000?",
