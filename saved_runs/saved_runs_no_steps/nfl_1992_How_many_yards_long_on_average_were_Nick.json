New York took flight in the first quarter as kicker Nick Folk made a 25-yard field goal. The Jets added onto their lead in the second quarter as Folk booted a 53-yard and a 22-yard field goal. New York continued to build their lead in the third quarter as Folk nailed a 34-yard field goal. The Vikings answered with quarterback Brett Favre completed a 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Randy Moss, yet the Jets came right back with Folk's 31-yard field goal. After the match was delayed due to adverse weather conditions, Minnesota began to strike back in the fourth quarter as Favre connected with wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 34-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion). Afterwards, New York answer as running back Shonn Greene got a 23-yard touchdown run. The Vikings tried to rally as Favre found Harvin again on an 11-yard touchdown pass, yet the Jets put the game away as cornerback Dwight Lowery returned an interception 26 yards for a touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards long on average were Nick Folk's field goals?",
