    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game losing streak, the Cowboys went home for a Week 7 NFC East duel with the New York Giants on Monday night.  Dallas got the opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback Tony Romo found tight end Jason Witten on a 4-yard touchdown run, followed by a 26-yard field goal from kicker David Buehler.  The Giants answered with quarterback Eli Manning completing a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hakeem Nicks.  The Cowboys would add onto their lead in the second quarter as Buehler booted a 41-yard field goal, followed by rookie wide receiver Dez Bryant returning a punt 93 yards for a touchdown.  New York took the lead with Manning throwing an 8-yard touchdown pass to Nicks and a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Smith.  Afterwards, the Giants closed out the half with kicker Lawrence Tynes getting a 53-yard field goal. During the half, Dallas quarterback Tony Romo was suffered a broken left clavicle on a completion from a blocking error. Dallas' deficit increased in the third quarter as Manning completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mario Manningham, followed by running back Brandon Jacobs getting a 30-yard touchdown run.  The Cowboys began to rally in the fourth quarter as quarterback Jon Kitna found Bryant on a 15-yard touchdown pass (with a successful two-point conversion pass to Witten), yet New York answered with a 26-yard field goal from Tynes.  Dallas tried to rally as Kitna hooked up with Bryant again on a 15-yard touchdown pass. With the loss, the Cowboys fell to 1-5. Tony Romo (5/7 for 39 yards, TD) left the game in the second quarter with a broken left clavicle.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest touchdown pass?",
