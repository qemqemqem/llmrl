    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns returned home after a tough road loss to take on the Jaguars.  The Jags would score first in the first quarter when Blake Bortles found Marcedes Lewis on a 10-yard pass to make it 7-0 for the quarter's only score.  In the second quarter they made it 10-0 when Josh Lambo kicked a 38-yard field goal.  The Browns got on the board when DeShone Kizer found Duke Johnson on a 27-yard pass to make it 10-7 at halftime.  In the second half, it was all Jags after a scoreless third quarter as Lambo nailed a 39-yard field goal to make it 13-7 followed up by Telvin Smith recovering a fumble in the end zone for a touchdown (with a failed 2-point conversion) to make the final score 19-7. The Browns committed 5 turnovers, including 2 interceptions and 2 lost fumbles from Kizer, as they lost 19-7 to the Jaguars.  With the loss, the Browns fell to 0-10, losing their 11th consecutive game.  It's only the second time in franchise history that the Browns started a season 0-10, with the first such occurrence happening in the previous season.  The loss made the Browns 4-43 in their last 47 games, a record that started in Week 13 of the 2014 season, the worst 47 game stretch in NFL history.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team led at halftime?",
