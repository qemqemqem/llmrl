    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Cowboys began their season at Raymond James Stadium for a Week 1 duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first quarter, Dallas shot first as kicker Nick Folk got a 51-yard and a 22-yard field goal.  The Buccaneers responded in the second quarter as running back Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams got a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Cowboys regained the lead as quarterback Tony Romo completed a 42-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Miles Austin. Dallas increased their lead in the third quarter as Romo completed a 66-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roy Williams.  In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay answered with running back Derrick Ward getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Cowboys struck right back with Romo completing an 80-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Patrick Crayton, along with running back Marion Barber getting a 6-yard touchdown run.  Afterwards, Tampa Bay's rally only produced a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Byron Leftwich to tight end Kellen Winslow.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown in the game?",
