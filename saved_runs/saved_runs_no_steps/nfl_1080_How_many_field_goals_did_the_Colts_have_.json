    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Colts began their 2008 campaign with their first official home game at Lucas Oil Stadium.  For this Sunday night interconference duel, they took on the Chicago Bears in a rematch of Super Bowl XLI.  In the first quarter, Indianapolis was first out of the gate as kicker Adam Vinatieri got a 39-yard field goal.  The Bears responded with RB Matt Forte getting a 50-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Colts responded with Vinatieri nailing a 34-yard field goal.  However, Chicago increased its lead with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 41-yard field goal, DE Adewale Ogunleye tackling RB Joseph Addai in his endzone for a safety (first time Indy gave up a safety since November 2000), and Gould nailing a 25-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Indianapolis tried to rally as QB Peyton Manning completed a 6-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, yet the Bears replied with LB Lance Briggs returned a fumble 21&#160;yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, Chicago sealed the win with FB Jason McKie getting a 1-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did the Colts have?",
