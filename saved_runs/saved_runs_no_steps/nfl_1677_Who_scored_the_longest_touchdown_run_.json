    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill looking for their first win of the season, the Titans flew to Gillette Stadium, donned Oilers throwback uniforms, and played a Week 6 AFL Legacy game with the New England Patriots in a rare October snowstorm. Tennessee's struggles continued as Patriots running back Laurence Maroney got a 45-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker Stephen Gostkowski making a 33-yard field goal.  Things got worse for the Titans in the second quarter as quarterback Tom Brady completed five touchdown passes, two to wide receiver Randy Moss (40-yard and 28-yard), one to running back Kevin Faulk (38-yard), and two to wide receiver Wes Welker (30-yard and 5-yard).  The Patriots' 45-0 halftime lead was the largest in NFL history.  New England would then conclude their scoring in the third quarter with Brady's 9-yard touchdown pass to Moss, followed by backup quarterback Brian Hoyer's one-yard touchdown run. With the loss, not only did the Titans go into the bye week at 0-6 (their first such start since 1984), but they suffered their worst loss in franchise history, eclipsing a 61-7 loss to Cincinnati in 1989, when the team was the Houston Oilers. This was the first 59-0 game since 1976, and only the fourth in NFL history. It was the largest blowout in the 2009 season, and tied the post-merger record for largest margin of victory.\n\nQuestion:\nWho scored the longest touchdown run?",
