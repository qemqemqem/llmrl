    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Bills flew to FedExField for a Week 13 interconference duel with an emotionally charged Washington Redskins. Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as all players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. Due to the recent poor play of QB J. P. Losman, rookie QB Trent Edwards once again got the start. In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Bills continued to trail as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Buffalo got on the board as LB Angelo Crowell sacked Washington QB Jason Campbell in his own endzone for a safety.  The Redskins would end the half with Suisham getting a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills started to reply as kicker Rian Lindell got a 38-yard field goal, yet Washington replied with RB Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard TD run.  Buffalo would close out the period with Lindell kicking a 43-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, followed by a 33-yard field goal.  On the Bills final drive, Lindell managed to set up for a 51-yard field goal.  The first try was good, but Redskins Head Coach Joe Gibbs called time out.  After the first time out, Gibbs tried to call a second time out, which led to them getting called for unsportsmanlike conduct and the Bills moved 15 yards closer to the end zone, which reduced Lindell's field goal to 36 yards.  In the end, Lindell managed to nail the game-winning 36-yard field goal, squeaking a last second win in the dying seconds of the game. With the win, Buffalo snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to 6-6.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were between 20 and 30 yards?",
