    "problem_text": "Context:\nK\u0117dainiai was attacked by the 2nd Riflemen Regiment of Lithuanian  Division . Lithuanian forces from Panev\u0117\u017eys, commanded by Jonas Variakojis, and from K\u0117dainiai numbered only about 200 men. Lithuanians withstood Red Army advance near K\u0117dainiai and with German support repelled it. On February 8, during the course of a reconnaissance mission, Povilas Luk\u0161ys became the first Lithuanian soldier to die in the war. On February 10, joint Lithuanian and German forces captured \u0160\u0117ta and forced the Red Army to retreat. The success of this operation lifted the Lithuanian army's morale and prevented the Red Army from encircling Kaunas from the north. On February 9, Soviet 7th Riflemen Regiment  took over Jieznas, south of Kaunas. The following day Lithuanian forces  from Prienai and Kaunas attacked before the Red Army could consolidate position, but were betrayed by their Russian commander and suffered a defeat: 18 Lithuanians were killed and 33 were taken prisoners. Lithuanians retreated, were reinforced by new Lithuanian and Saxon Volunteers, attacked again, and took Jieznas on February 13. The Soviets continued to push for Kaunas. The 3rd and 4th Riflemen Regiments  attacked Alytus on February 12. Germans did not engage in battle and retreated; not yet fully formed Lithuanian 1st Infantry Regiment could not withstand pressure from the Red Army and had to retreat towards Marijampol\u0117 and Prienai. Antanas Juozapavi\u010dius, the first Lithuanian officer to die in the wars, was killed during this battle. On the night of February 14-15, German forces and one company of the Lithuanians returned to Alytus and retook the city. Kaunas was defended and the front stabilized for a while. Soviets were ordered to abandon the offensive and maintain defensive position. This break allowed Lithuanians to better organize and train the volunteers.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many days was it between the time the Red Army took over Jieznas and it was taken back by the Lithuanians?",
