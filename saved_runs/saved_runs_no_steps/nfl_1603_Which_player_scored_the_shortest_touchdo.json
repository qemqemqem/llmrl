    "problem_text": "Context:\nFollowing a tough road loss against the Bears, the Steelers flew to Paul Brown Stadium for a Week 3 AFC North duel with the Cincinnati Bengals.  Pittsburgh would strike first in the first quarter with kicker Jeff Reed's 19-yard field goal and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's 27-yard touchdown pass to running back Willie Parker.  The Steelers would add onto their lead in the second quarter as Reed made a 34-yard field goal.  The Bengals would close out the half with kicker Shayne Graham's 34-yard field goal. Cincinnati would creep closer in the third quarter as cornerback Johnathan Joseph returned an interception 30&#160;yards for a touchdown (with a failed PAT), yet Pittsburgh answered with Roethlisberger's 1-yard touchdown run.  However, in the fourth quarter, the Bengals took the lead with running back Cedric Benson's 23-yard touchdown run (with a failed 2-point conversion) and quarterback Carson Palmer's 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Andre Caldwell (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to running back Brian Leonard).  The Steelers tried to rally, but Roethlisberger's last-second hail mary pass was incomplete, preserving the defeat. With the loss, Pittsburgh fell to 1-2 and 3rd place in the AFC North.  This would also become the team's first 1-2 start since 2006. Wide receiver Hines Ward (4 receptions, 82&#160;yards) would become the 21st player in NFL history to surpass 800 career receptions and 10,000 receiving yards.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player scored the shortest touchdown?",
