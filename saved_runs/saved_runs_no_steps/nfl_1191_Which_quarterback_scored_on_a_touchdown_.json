    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Eagles improved to 10-0 after the bye under Andy Reid with a 27-14 victory over the 4-2 Atlanta Falcons.  The Eagles offense struggled to get into a rhythm through the first quarter and a half, with Donovan McNabb misfiring on several passes.  Atlanta scored first with a 55-yard catch and run from Matt Ryan to Roddy White.  The Eagles tied the score when McNabb capped off a long drive with a 3-yard quarterback draw for a touchdown.  Philadelphia drove down the field and scored on a 36-yard David Akers field goal in just 45 seconds before halftime.  The Eagles continued to roll on their opening possession of the third quarter, scoring on a 16-yard run by Brian Westbrook to open up a 17-7 lead.  Atlanta drove to the Philadelphia 1-yard line in the third quarter, but Lito Sheppard intercepted a fade to the end zone.  In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia's offense failed to capitalize on yet another goal line situation, and instead settled for a field goal, giving Atlanta hope.  The Falcons responded with an impressive drive that ended in a touchdown pass to Roddy White, making it 20-14.  The Eagles went three and out and punted, but the officials ruled the punt was muffed by Adam Jennings and recovered by the Eagles.  Atlanta, out of timeouts, could not challenge the controversial call, and two plays later Westbrook broke a 39-yard touchdown to the left side to put the game away.  Westbrook rushed for 167 yards and two touchdowns and had 42 receiving yards.  McNabb had 253 passing yards and also ran for 25 yards.  The win was the 100th of Reid's career and the 500th in the history of the franchise.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich quarterback scored on a touchdown run?",
