    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to stop a three-game losing streak, the Giants hosted the Baltimore Ravens in a rematch of their 33-14 loss in 2012. Eli Manning threw his 300th career touchdown to Roger Lewis late in the second quarter. The Giants stormed on points with an Odell Beckham Jr. 75-yard touchdown followed by a Justin Tucker field goal to make the game 20-16. The Giants then stopped Terrance West on 4th and goal early in the 4th quarter. Late in the 4th quarter, the Ravens drove down the field and scored making the game 23-20. Eli Manning and the Giants responded with Eli completing a 66-yard touchdown to Beckham to make the score 27-23. The Ravens drove down the field but were stopped with Joe Flacco throwing an incompletion in the final seconds allowing the Giants to break their three-game losing streak. The Giants improved to 3-3, and their all-time record against the Ravens improved to 2-4. This win was also the Giants 700th win in franchise history. This game started a six-game winning streak for the Giants that would last until Week 13.\n\nQuestion:\nWho had the longest touchdown of the game?",
