    "problem_text": "Context:\nIronically, the Jets were the underdogs against the 0-11 Dolphins, according to Las Vegas bookmakers. The Jets opened the game by getting on the board with a direct snap touchdown run by Leon Washington. Long field goals by Jay Feely for the Dolphins cut the Jets' lead to one. Immediately after Feely's second field goal, Jets quarterback Kellen Clemens found Justin McCareins on a long pass for 50&#160;yards, but the drive quickly stalled, and New York was forced to settle for Mike Nugent's 29-yard field goal. On the Jets' next possession, Clemens was hit on one of six Dolphins sacks by Will Allen; the ball popped out on the hit and was recovered by Michael Lehan, who returned the fumble 43&#160;yards for a touchdown to give the Dolphins a 13-10 lead. Aided by consecutive Dolphins penalties prior to kickoff, however, the good field position on the Jets' ensuing drive allowed Clemens to find Brad Smith on a 19-yard touchdown reception to put the Jets back on top. A Kerry Rhodes interception on the Dolphins' next possession allowed the Jets to tack on a 40-yard field goal just before halftime. Turnovers for the Jets' defense allowed New York to take control of the game in the second half. Rookie Dolphins quarterback John Beck's fumble on a sack in third quarter led to Nugent's 35-yard attempt to increase the Jets' lead to ten. After Beck lost another fumble on the Dolphins' next series, the Jets drove down to Miami's one-yard line, where Thomas Jones scored his first touchdown in his twelfth game as a Jet. On Miami's next possession, an interception by Drew Coleman gave the Jets another scoring opportunity, which turned out to be Nugent's fourth field goal of the day. Leon Washington's 12-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter ended the scoring.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player scored the first Dolphins touchdown?",
