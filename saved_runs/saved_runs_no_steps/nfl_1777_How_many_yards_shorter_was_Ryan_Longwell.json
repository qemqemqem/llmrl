    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Bills the Bears played on home ground for an NFC North rivalry match against the Vikings. In the first quarter the Bears trailed early after kicker Ryan Longwell hit a 36-yard field goal. They took the lead in the second quarter when QB Jay Cutler threw a 17-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen. They fell behind after QB Brett Favre completed a 53-yard TD pass to WR Percy Harvin. They got the lead back when Cutler got a 19-yard TD pass to WR Devin Hester. The Bears extended their lead in the third quarter after kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 34-yard field goal. The Vikings replied with Longwell making a 33-yard field goal, but the Bears continued to score with Gould hitting a 37-yard field goal, and in the 4th quarter with Cutler making a 19-yard TD pass to TE Kellen Davis.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards shorter was Ryan Longwell's second field goal compared to his first?",
