    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Rams the Chiefs played on home ground for an AFC duel with the Titans.  The Chiefs took the early lead as QB Matt Cassel threw 14- and 5-yard TD passes to RB Jamaal Charles.  This was followed by kicker Ryan Succop nailing a 35-yard field goal, then with Cassel making a 75-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe.  The Titans responded as QB Kerry Collins got a 53-yard TD pass to WR Kenny Britt, but the Chiefs extended their lead with SS Eric Berry returning an interception 54 yards for a touchdown.  This was followed by Succop making a 42-yard field goal.  The Titans tried to come back, but only came away with Collins completing a 22-yard TD pass to TE Jared Cook.  The defense controlled the fourth quarter, giving the Chiefs the win. Kansas City improved to 10-5 with the win, matching its win total over the previous three seasons combined. Later in the day, the Chiefs clinched their sixth AFC West division title when San Diego lost at Cincinnati.\n\nQuestion:\nWho completed the longest TD pass?",
