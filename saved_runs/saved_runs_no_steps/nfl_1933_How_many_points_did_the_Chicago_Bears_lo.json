    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Vikings took their 2010 bye week in Week 4 of the season - their earliest bye week since the 2004 season. There were mixed results for their divisional rivals, with the Green Bay Packers beating the Detroit Lions by 2 points, while the Chicago Bears were beaten 17-3 by the New York Giants. In the days leading to their Week 5 game, the Vikings pulled off a dramatic trade, acquiring receiver Randy Moss from the New England Patriots. The move reunited Moss with the team that drafted him in 1998 and came after Moss caught 50 touchdowns with New England, including a one-handed touchdown catch against the Jets four weeks earlier.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Chicago Bears lose by?",
