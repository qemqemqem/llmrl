    "problem_text": "Context:\nA truce was signed at Pons on 1 August. A more lasting peace was concluded at Paris on 4 December 1259 amidst the threat of a second Baron's war in England. Initially, Henry refused to give up the rights the territory of his ancestors in France, however, Louis restored Guyenne to Henry, thinking that this noble gesture would assure him an extended time of peace with England because he was mostly concerned with going on the Seventh Crusade in 1248 and wanted to rally support for the cause within his own realm. By signing the treaty, Louis and Henry put an end to the century-old conflict between Capetians and Plantagenets concerning the lands inherited by Henry II of England conquered by Philip Augustus of France. By this text, Henry III renounces his claims concerning Normandy, Anjou, Touraine, Maine, and Poitou and Louis IX gave him the necessary sum to maintain 500 knights for two years and the revenues of the Agenais and his domains in the dioceses of Limoges, Cahors, and P\u00e9rigueux. On February 10 1259, the treaty is first ratified by Richard of Cornwall. On February 17, it was ratified in Westminster by prosecutors in the name of the king, and, by December 4, Simon V de Montfort and Eleanor of England also ratified the treaty. Finally, Henry arrived in France on December 4 1259 to pay homage to Louis, thus symbolically ending the rivalry. Afterwards, an unexpected and lively friendship arised between the two kings to the point that, sometime later, Louis offered Henry an elephant which had been given to him by the Sultan of Egypt and ratified a papal bull, as the feudal overlord of Henry, that annulled the Provisions of Oxford and declared himself as a firm supporter of the Royal prerogative in England.\n\nQuestion:\nLouis gave back what place to Henry thinking it would assure him extended peace?",
