    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill searching for their first win, the Rams went home for a Week 4 interconference duel with the Buffalo Bills. Hoping to find consistency, QB Marc Bulger was benched in favor of QB Trent Green. In the first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Bills kicker Rian Lindell got a 45-yard field goal. The Rams would respond with rookie WR Donnie Avery getting a 37-yard TD run.  Buffalo would answer with Lindell kicking a 35-yard field goal. In the second quarter, St. Louis increased its lead with RB Steven Jackson getting a 29-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Bills crept closer as RB Fred Jackson got a 22-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Buffalo sealed the win with CB Jabari Greer returning an interception 33 yards for a touchdown, QB Trent Edwards completing a 39-yard TD pass to WR Lee Evans, and Lindell nailing a 45-yard field goal. With the loss, the Rams went into their bye week at 0-4. Head coach Scott Linehan was fired after the loss and was replaced by Jim Haslett.\n\nQuestion:\nFrom what distance did Rian Lindell kick two field goals?",
