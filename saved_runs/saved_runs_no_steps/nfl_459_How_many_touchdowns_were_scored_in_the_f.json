    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a three-game slide, the Falcons went home for a Week 14 Monday Night NFC South rematch with the New Orleans Saints. Making his first start at QB since 2002 was Chris Redman. In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR David Patten. The Falcons answered with Redman completing a 33-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. In the second quarter, New Orleans began to pull away as kicker Olindo Mare made a 23-yard field goal, while Brees completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Marques Colston. In the third quarter, the Saints pulled away as Brees and Colston hooked up with each other again on a 2-yard TD pass, while safety Roman Harper returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Atlanta got one last touchdown and Redman completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins. New Orleans sealed the win with Mare's 36-yard field goal. Following the game, it was announced that head coach Bobby Petrino had resigned from the Falcons. Afterwards, on Wednesday, December 12, it was announced that defensive backs coach Emmitt Thomas would be Atlanta's interim head coach for the rest of the season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were scored in the first quarter?",
