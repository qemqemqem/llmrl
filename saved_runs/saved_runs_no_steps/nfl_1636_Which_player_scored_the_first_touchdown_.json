    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a three-game losing streak, the 49ers went home for a Week 9 interconference duel with the Tennessee Titans. In the first quarter, San Francisco struck first as kicker Joe Nedney made a 40-yard field goal. The Titans would respond with a 21-yard field goal from kicker Rob Bironas. Tennessee would take the lead in the second quarter as quarterback Vince Young got a 7-yard touchdown run, yet the 49ers regained the lead with running back Frank Gore's 3-yard touchdown run and quarterback Alex Smith's 12-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jason Hill. The Titans would tie the game in the third quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Chris Johnson. San Francisco would begin the fourth quarter with Nedney booting a 25-yard field goal, but Tennessee would take the lead with Johnson's 2-yard touchdown run, kicker Rob Bironas' 28-yard field goal, and cornerback Cortland Finnegan returning an interception 39&#160;yards for a touchdown. The Niners tried to rally as Smith hooked up with Hill again on a 3-yard touchdown pass, but the Titans' defense would prevent further progress.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player scored the first touchdown of the game?",
