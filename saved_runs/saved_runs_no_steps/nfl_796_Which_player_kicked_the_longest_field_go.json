    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game skid, the Chargers went home for an AFC West duel with the Kansas City Chiefs.  In the first quarter, San Diego's struggling offense found some life with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 24-yard field goal, while RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 5-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Chargers increased its lead with Kaeding kicking a 51-yard field goal.  The Chiefs would answer with kicker Dave Rayner getting a 25-yard field goal.  Afterwards, San Diego ended the half with Kaeding getting a 38-yard field goal.  Unfortunately, in the third quarter, the Chargers lost their lead Kansas City getting a 41-yard field goal from Rayner and QB Damon Huard completing a 22-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  Even worse, San Diego ended up losing in the fourth quarter with Huard completing a 51-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe, along with CB Tyron Brackenridge returning a fumble 50 yards for a touchdown. One of the few positives from the game, Tomlinson would finally get his first 100-yard game of the year.  He would get 132 rushing yards on 20 carries.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player kicked the longest field goal?",
