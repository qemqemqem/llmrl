    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Baltimore Ravens traveled to INVESCO Field at Mile High for Monday Night Football on October 9. The last time these two teams played, on December 11, 2005, the Broncos won 12-10.  The Broncos won 13-3 and improved to 3-1, still tied for first place in the division with the San Diego Chargers. The Ravens got on the board first when Matt Stover kicked a 24-yard field goal, following a fumble by Broncos RB Tatum Bell. The Broncos responded with a 43-yard field goal of their own by Jason Elam.  The Ravens drove deep into Broncos territory late at the end of the first half, but that drive was thwarted as Steve McNair was intercepted by Champ Bailey in the end zone on a pass intended for Clarence Moore.  The third quarter was scoreless as the defensive struggle continued.  The Broncos controlled the clock in the second half with the running game led by Tatum Bell, who atoned for his fumble in the first quarter by bouncing back with 92 yards rushing. Ravens QB McNair was intercepted again by Darrent Williams, which led to a Jake Plummer to Rod Smith touchdown pass.  McNair was intercepted a third time, ending the Ravens' final drive, this time by Domonique Foxworth.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many times was Steve McNair intercepted?",
