    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their Bye Week, the Cardinals went home for a Week 10 fight with the Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early as kicker Mike Vanderjagt nailed a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Cardinals' year-long struggles continued as QB Tony Romo completed a 30-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  The Cards would respond with a 28-yard field goal by kicker Neil Rackers.  Afterwards, Vanderjagt gave the Cowboys some breathing room with a 38-yard field goal as time ran out on the half.  In the third quarter, things continued to get worse for Arizona as Romo completed a 51-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas would wrap up the game with RB Marion Barber's 5-yard TD run.  The Cardinals would get a touchdown as QB Matt Leinart got a 3-yard TD run.  However, the Cards would drop their eighth-straight game.  With the loss, the Cardinals fell to 1-8.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards shorter was Vanderjagt's first field goal compared with his second?",
