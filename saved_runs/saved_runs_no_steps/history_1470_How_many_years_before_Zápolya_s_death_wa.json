    "problem_text": "Context:\nStephen B\u00e1thory was born on 27 September 1533 in the castle at Somly\u00f3, also known as Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 . He was the son of Stephen VIII B\u00e1thory  of the noble Hungarian B\u00e1thory family and his wife Catherine Telegdi. He had at least five siblings: two brothers and three sisters. Little is known about his childhood. Around 1549-1550 he briefly visited Italy and probably spent a few months attending lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks. Some time after 1553 B\u00e1thory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Z\u00e1polya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Z\u00e1polya's supporter, B\u00e1thory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time he fell out of favour at Z\u00e1polya's court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bekes. B\u00e1thory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and was seen as a possible successor to Z\u00e1polya. After Z\u00e1polya's death in 1571, the Transylvanian estates elected B\u00e1thory Voivode of Transylvania. Bekes, supported by the Habsburgs, disputed his election, but by 1573 B\u00e1thory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and drove Bekes out of Transylvania. He subsequently attempted to play the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire against one another in an attempt to strengthen the Transylvania position.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years before Z\u00e1polya's death was Stephen B\u00e1thory born?",
