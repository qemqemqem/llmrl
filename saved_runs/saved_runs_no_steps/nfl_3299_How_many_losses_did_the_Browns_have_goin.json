    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns then returned home for a game against the Titans.  In a highly defensive battle of no touchdowns, the Titans scored first when Ryan Succop kicked a 41-yard field goal to make it 3-0.  The Browns tied it up when Zane Gonzalez kicked a 31-yard field goal to make it 3-3.  The Titans retook the lead with Succop's 23-yard field goal to make it 6-3 at halftime.  The Browns then tied it up when Zane Gonzalez nailed 47-yard field goal to make it 6-6 for the only points in the third quarter.  The Titans then moved ahead in the fourth quarter after Succop kicked another field goal from 46 yards out to make it 9-6.  The Browns forced overtime when Gonzalez nailed a 54-yard field goal to make it 9-9.  In overtime, the Titans scored the eventual game-winning field goal when Succop nailed it from 47 yards out to make the final score 12-9. With the overtime loss, the Browns fell to 0-7.  The loss led to Browns starting 0-7 for only the 4th time in franchise history (1975, 1999, and 2016).  It was the first time in 23 games under Hue Jackson that the Browns failed to score a touchdown.  This game was the first such occurrence since Week 17 of the 2015 season.  During the third quarter, star left tackle Joe Thomas suffered an injury to his arm and was knocked out of the rest of the game, making this the first time since joining the Browns in 2007 that he had missed an offensive play.  The day after the game, it was announced that Thomas had torn his triceps and would likely miss the rest of the season. It would also be his last ever NFL game, as Thomas announced his retirement on March 14, 2018.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many losses did the Browns have going into this game?",
