    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe December 2010 North American blizzard postponed the game until Tuesday, December 28, 2010 at 8:00&#160;p.m. The NFL postponed the game shortly after noon, even before there was any snow accmuluation in Philadelphia, after Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter declared a snow emergency for the city. This was the 20th NFL game to be played on a Tuesday, and the first  since 1946. This was also the first Tuesday game in Vikings franchise history. Trying to snap a two-game losing streak, the Vikings flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 16 intraconference duel with the Philadelphia Eagles on Tuesday night. Minnesota trailed in the first quarter as Eagles quarterback Michael Vick completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Clay Harbor. The Vikings answered in the second quarter with cornerback Antoine Winfield returning a fumble 45 yards for a touchdown. Minnesota took the lead in the third quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell, followed by a 9-yard touchdown run from rookie quarterback Joe Webb. Philadelphia struck back with Vick getting a 10-yard touchdown run which cut the lead to a field goal, but the Vikings came right back with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Adrian Peterson.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team scored more points?",
