Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The clubs kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998. Real Madrids first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982\u201383, 1983\u201384 and 1984\u201385 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992. In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the clubs website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens AG and in 2006, the BenQ logo appeared on the clubs shirt. Real Madrids shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens. Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed their sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth \u20ac70 million per year. In 2015, Madrid signed a new 10-year contract with Adidas believed to be worth a total of \u00a3850 million (\u20ac1 billion), earning \u00a359 million (\u20ac64 million) per season.\n\nQuestion:\nWho sponsored Real Madrid first, Seimens AG or BenQ?",
