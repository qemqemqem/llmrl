    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their Monday Night road loss to the Browns, the Giants went home for a Week 7 duel with the San Francisco 49ers.  In the first quarter, New York drew first blood as RB Brandon Jacobs got a 26-yard TD run.  The 49ers responded with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 40-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the G-Men increased their lead as Jacobs got a 2-yard TD run.  San Francisco answered with QB J.T. O'Sullivan completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Josh Morgan.  The Giants would close out the half with kicker John Carney getting a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New York added onto their lead as QB Eli Manning completed a 6-yard TD pass to WR Plaxico Burress.  The 49ers would reply as CB Nate Clements returned a blocked field goal 74 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, the G-Men pulled away as Carney nailed a 48-yard field goal, along with DE Justin Tuck forcing an O'Sulivan fumble that would roll towards the 49ers' endzone, causing Morgan to kick the ball out of the back of the endzone, giving New York a safety.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many is the difference in the number of yards of the first TD run by Jacobs and the yards of the second TD run by Jacobs?",
