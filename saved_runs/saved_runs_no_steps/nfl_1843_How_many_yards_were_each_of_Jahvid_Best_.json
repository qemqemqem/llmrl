    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Lions opened the season at Soldier Field against their NFC North foe the Chicago Bears. The Bears took an early lead in the first quarter with a 20-yard field goal by kicker Robbie Gould. The Lions answered with 2 consecutive touchdowns by rookie running back Jahvid Best. First a 7-yard run, and later in the second quarter with a 4-yard run. The Bears responded with an 89-yard catch and run touchdown by Matt Fort&#233; and later with a 31-yard field goal from Gould just before halftime. The only score of the second half was a 28-yard touchdown catch by Fort&#233; (with a failed 2-point conversion), giving the Bears a late lead. Late in the game, quarterback Shaun Hill completed what would have been the game-winning 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson.  A touchdown was initially signaled, but the officials conferred and ruled that Johnson did not \"complete the catch during the process of the catch.\"  The play was reviewed and the ruling on the field of an incomplete pass stood.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards were each of Jahvid Best's touchdowns?",
