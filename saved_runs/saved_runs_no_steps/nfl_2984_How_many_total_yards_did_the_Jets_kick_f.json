    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn the Jets' second play of the game, Ryan Fitzpatrick was strip-sacked by Jones with Hightower recovering at the Jets 19. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, but Gostkowski gave the Patriots the lead on a 38-yard field goal. The Jets countered with a 15 play drive all the way to the Patriots 2-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 20-yard field goal by Nick Folk. After a Patriots punt, the Jets strung together a 14 play, 83-yard drive scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Jeremy Kerley, giving the Jets a 10-3 lead in the second quarter. A few possessions later, the Patriots marched 47 yards, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Brady on 4th-and-Goal, tying the game. After a Jets punt, Edelman gave the Patriots a good start with a 17-yard return to the Patriots 41. The Patriots drove to the Jets 20, but an 8-yard sack by Calvin Pace forced the Patriots to settle for a 47-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 13-10 lead at halftime. After Amendola returned the opening kickoff 28 yards to the Jets 29, the Patriots drove all the way to the Jets 6, but were forced to settle for another field goal, increasing the lead to 16-10. The Jets countered with a 13 play, 80-yard drive, taking seven minutes off the clock, scoring on a 9-yard pass to Chris Ivory, giving the Jets a 17-16 lead. After a Patriots punt, the Jets drove all the way to the Jets 12, but settled for a 30-yard field goal by Folk, increasing their lead to 20-16 a few minutes into the fourth quarter. The Patriots countered with a 10 play, 80-yard march, scoring on an 8-yard touchdown pass to Amendola, retaking the lead 23-20. After the Jets punted, the Patriots scored again, with Brady's 15-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski widening their lead to 30-20 with just 1:13 remaining. The Jets drove to the Patriots 37 and Folk trimmed the deficit to 30-23 with a 55-yard field goal with just 0:18 seconds left. Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick at the Patriots 49 with 14 seconds left, giving the Jets a chance to tie game. After a 12-yard catch by Eric Decker, Marshall was flagged for a false start, allowing the clock to run out and end the game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards did the Jets kick for field goals?",
