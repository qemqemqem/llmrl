    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter a tough loss at home, the Browns traveled to take on the Packers.  In the first quarter, it was all Packers as Aaron Rodgers found Jermichael Finley on a 10-yard pass taking a 7-0 lead followed up by Eddie Lacy running for a 1-yard touchdown for a 14-0 lead.  In the second quarter, the Browns got on the board as Billy Cundiff kicked a 46-yard field goal 14-3 game.  Though the Packers moved ahead by 2 touchdowns at halftime when Mason Crosby nailed a 26-yard field goal for a 17-3 game.  In the third quarter, the Browns would score the only points when Cundiff kicked another field goal this time from 44 yards out for a 17-6 game.  In the fourth quarter, the Packers went back to work as Rodgers found Jordy Nelson on a 1-yard pass for a 24-6 game.  The Browns came within 11 again as Brandon Weeden found Jordan Cameron on a 2-yard pass for a 24-13 game.  The Packers would later on seal the game when Rodgers found Jarrett Boykin on a 20-yard pass for the eventual final score 31-13.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Browns lose the game by?",
