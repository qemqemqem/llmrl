    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to build on their recent victory over the Texans, the Titans flew to Alltel Stadium for an AFC South fight with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  From the get-go, the Titans fell behind, as Jags QB David Garrard completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Ernest Wilford and a 14-yard TD pass to TE George Wrighster in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee would kick a 47-yard and a 21-yard field goal in the second quarter, giving Jacksonville a 20-0 lead over Tennessee at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Titans woes continued as Garrard hooked up with Wilford again on a 22-yard TD strike.  Then, DB Scott Starks returned an interception 55 yards for a touchdown.  Finally, Scobee would kick a 39-yard field goal, putting the game out of reach.  In the fourth quarter, Tennessee would get their only score of the game, as QB Vince Young completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Drew Bennett.  With the loss, the Titans fell to 2-6.\n\nQuestion:\nWho caught the longest touchdown reception of the game?",
