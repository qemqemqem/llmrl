    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Redskins, the Cowboys stayed at home for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Cincinnati Bengals.  In the first quarter, the Cowboys shot first as kicker Nick Folk got a 30-yard field goal, along with rookie RB Felix Jones getting a 33-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Dallas increased its lead with QB Tony Romo completing a 4-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.  The Bengals closed out the half as kicker Shayne Graham got a 41-yard and a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati crept closer as QB Carson Palmer completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals got within one point as Graham kicked a 40-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys responded with Romo completing a 57-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens. The Bengals tried to come back as Palmer completed a 10-yard TD pass to Houshmandzadeh (with a failed two-point conversion), but Dallas pulled away as Romo completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich quarterback had more passing touchdowns?",
