    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their season-sweeping home win over the Ravens, the Bengals flew to Heinz Field for a Week 10 AFC North rematch with the Pittsburgh Steelers with 1st place in the division on the line. Cincinnati would trail in the first quarter as Steelers kicker Jeff Reed got a 28-yard field goal.  The Bengals would immediately strike back as rookie running back Bernard Scott returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, Pittsburgh would retake the lead with Reed's 33-yard and 35-yard field goals. Cincinnati would regain the lead in the third quarter with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 23-yard and a 32-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Steelers would tie the game with Reed booting a 34-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Bengals would pull away with Graham nailing a 32-yard and a 43-yard field goal. With the win, not only did the Bengals improve to 7-2, but they acquired their first season-sweep over Pittsburgh since 1998 as the Steelers fell to 6-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
