    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their tough divisional road loss to the 49ers, the Cardinals played their Week 2 homeopener against their NFC West foe, the Seattle Seahawks.  In the first quarter, the Cards took to the skies first with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Arizona continued to pound away with QB Matt Leinart completing a 30-yard TD pass to TE Leonard Pope, along RB Edgerrin James getting a 17-yard TD run.  The Seahawks would get their only score of the half with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson. In the third quarter, the Cardinals' lead was gone with Seattle RB Shaun Alexander getting a 16-yard TD run and kicker Josh Brown getting a 28-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Cards trailed as Brown got another 28-yard field goal.  Arizona responded with Rackers kicking a 52-yard field goal.  Late in the game, the Cards defense managed to recover a Seahawk fumble.  It would eventually turn into Rackers' 4th career game-winning field goal as made it from 42 yards out as time ran out.
