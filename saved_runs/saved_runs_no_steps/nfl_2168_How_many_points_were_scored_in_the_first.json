    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn Sunday night, the Bears would once again score on all three phases. The offensive line improved, allowing Jay Cutler to be sacked only once. Cutler would complete 21 of 31 passes for 267 yards with two touchdowns and a 115.9 passer rating. On the Bears opening possession, Cutler would fire a 48-yard touchdown pass to Devin Hester; it was the first time that the Bears scored a touchdown on the opening drive. Making his NFL debut, Stephen Paea sacked Donovan McNabb in the end zone for a safety, increasing the score to 9-0. Marion Barber would then score on a 3-yard run. Ryan Longwell would then kick a 37-yard field goal to make the score 16-3, but Cutler's 18-yard pass to Dane Sanzenbacher and Robbie Gould's 51-yard field goal increased the lead to 26-3. In the second half, Vikings defensive end Jared Allen would then force a fumble, and Adrian Peterson would then score, making the score 26-10, but Devin Hester would then return a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown to increase the lead to 33-10. Gould would then kick two field goals to end the game at 39-10. The Bears defense would record five sacks, including two by Julius Peppers, who started the game despite being listed as \"Doubtful\" due to a sprained knee. The defense would limit Peterson to just 39 yards, the lowest he recorded against the Bears.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points were scored in the first half of the game?",
