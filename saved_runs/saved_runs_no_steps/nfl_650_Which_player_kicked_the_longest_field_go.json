    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their home loss to the Packers, the Chiefs stayed at home for an AFC West duel with the Denver Broncos.  With RB Larry Johnson out with an injury, RB Priest Holmes would be making his first start in more than two seasons. In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Broncos kicker Jason Elam managed to get a 44-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Chiefs managed to tie the game with kicker Dave Rayner getting a 38-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Kansas City took the lead with Safety Bernard Pollard blocking a punt from deep within Denver territory.  The ball would roll the back of the endzone for a safety.  However, the Broncos went back into the lead with Elam getting a 50-yard field goal.  The Chiefs would take the halftime lead as Rayner kicked a 36-yard field goal. In the third quarter, K.C. trailed big as Denver RB Selvin Young got a 20-yard TD pass, while LB Nate Webster returned a fumble 17&#160;yards for a touchdown.  Even worse, starting-QB Damon Huard would leave the game on that play due to a concussion.  Back-up QB Brodie Croyle took over the Chiefs offense for the remainder of the game.  Later in the period, K.C. tried to rally as Rayner nailed a 39-yard field goal.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Broncos sealed the win with QB Jay Cutler completing an 18-yard TD pass to TE Daniel Graham. With the loss, not only did the Chiefs fall to 4-5, but it ended their 8-game home winning streak against division opponents. Priest Holmes, in his first start in over two years, ran 20 times for 65 yards, along with catching 2 passes for 14 yards.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player kicked the longest field goal?",
