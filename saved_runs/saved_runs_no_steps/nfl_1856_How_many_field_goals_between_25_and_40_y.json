    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn week 15, the Lions traveled south to Tampa, Florida to play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Lions took an early lead in the 1st quarter with a 10-yard TD catch by Nate Burleson. Tampa Bay tied it up in the second quarter with a 24-yard TD catch by Mike Williams, and later took the lead with a 39-yard TD run by LeGarrette Blount. The Lions answered just before halftime with a 41-yard field goal. The only score of the 3rd quarter was a 10-yard TD run by Maurice Morris of the Lions. Tampa Bay had 2 field goals in the fourth quarter, from 30 then 26 yards out. The Lions tied the game just before the end of regulation with a 28-yard field goal, taking it to overtime. In overtime the Lions got the ball first and kicked a 34-yard field goal for the win. With the win not only did the Lions improve to 4-10, but it broke their record 26-game road losing streak. It was also their first back to back wins since 2007.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals between 25 and 40 yards were made?",
