    "problem_text": "Context:\nWith both teams coming off of tough losses, the Panthers went on the road to face the formidable defense of the New York Jets in what was on paper a close matchup. Both teams sported identical 4-6 records and were top 3 in rushing offense, while sporting similar numbers in pass defense game. Things started out well for Carolina, their first drive taking almost 6 minutes of clock to drive down into Jets territory when bad luck struck them. A miscommunication between Jake Delhomme and Steve Smith resulted in a pass being fired at Smith while he wasn't looking, and it caromed off of Smith's leg into the arms of Jets' CB Darrelle Revis, who returned it 67 yards for a TD. It was the first of Delhomme's 4 INTs of the day, two each  by Revis and safety Kerry Rhodes. Rhodes' first set the Jets up in good field position, which the Jets were able to capitalize on when Thomas Jones ran the ball in for a 4-yard TD. The Panthers soon after that struggled to do anything against the Jets defense and secured only two John Kasay field goals for a 17-6 defeat. The Panthers fell to 4-7 and wound up losing Jake Delhomme to a broken finger on his throwing hand.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more points did the Jets score than the Panthers at the end of the game?",
