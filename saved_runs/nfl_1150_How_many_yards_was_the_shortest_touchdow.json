In the first quarter, the G-Men drew first blood as RB Brandon Jacobs got two 1-yard TD runs (with a failed PAT on the latter).  In the second quarter, New York increased their lead as QB Eli Manning completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Darcy Johnson.  The Ravens would respond with kicker Matt Stover getting a 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Baltimore tried to rally as QB Joe Flacco completed a 10-yard TD pass to FB Le'Ron McClain.  The Giants would answer with CB Aaron Ross returning an interception 50 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, New York pulled away as kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 19-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest touchdown run?",
