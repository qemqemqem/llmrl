To solve the problem, I used the information provided in the context and subtracted the percentage of Turkish Cypriots, Turkish citizens, and citizens of other countries from 100% to find the percentage of people who were not Turkish Cypriots.

However, I made an error in my calculation, which led to an incorrect answer.\n\nTo solve the problem more accurately, I could have used the information provided in the context to directly calculate the number of people who were not Turkish Cypriots. Specifically, I could have added the number of people with non-Cypriot Turkish-born parents, the number of people with parents born in other countries, and the number of residents with Turkish citizenship and citizenship of other countries.
