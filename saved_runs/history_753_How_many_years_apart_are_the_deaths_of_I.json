To solve the problem, I subtracted the year of Ferdinand's death (1494) from the year of Innocent's death (1492), which gave me an answer of 3. However, I overlooked the fact that Ferdinand died in January of 1494, which means that he died less than three years after Innocent's death in 1492. To solve the problem more accurately, I should have subtracted the year of Innocent's death from the year of Ferdinand's death and then accounted for the fact that Ferdinand died in January of 1494, which would have given me an answer of 2.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nPope Innocent VIII, in conflict with King Ferdinand I of Naples over Ferdinand's refusal to pay feudal dues to the papacy, excommunicated and deposed Ferdinand by a bull of 11 September 1489.  Innocent then offered the Kingdom of Naples to Charles VIII of France, who had a remote claim to its throne because his grandfather, Charles VII, King of France, had married Marie of Anjou  of the Angevin dynasty, the ruling family of Naples until 1442.  Innocent later settled his quarrel with Ferdinand and revoked the bans before dying in 1492, but the offer to Charles remained an apple of discord in Italian politics. Ferdinand died on January 25, 1494, and was succeeded by his son Alfonso II.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years apart are the deaths of Innocent and Ferdinand?",
