    "problem_text": "Context:\nWithout Brian Westbrook, but coming off their dominant defensive performance over the Steelers, the Eagles flew to Soldier Field for a Week 4 Sunday night duel with the Chicago Bears. The Bears started quickly, forcing a three-and-out, then scoring on three passing plays.  DeSean Jackson was responsible for gaining 66 of the 74 yards traveled on the next drive, including a 22-yard touchdown reception from Donovan McNabb to tie the score.  Kyle Orton passed to Marty Booker for a 23-yard touchdown to make it 14-7 Chicago in the second quarter, but the Eagles came right back with a quick drive ending in Correll Buckhalter scoring from a yard out.  After a missed 50-yard field goal by David Akers, the Bears used the short field to set up a 20-yard touchdown pass to Devin Hester. Akers missed another field goal in the third quarter before making two short kicks that came after Kyle Orton fumbled.  Robbie Gould booted a 41-yard kick to make it 24-20 Bears in the fourth quarter. McNabb then took the Eagles down the field, and with 5:40 left to play, Philadelphia had 1st-and-goal from the 4-yard line.  Buckhalter got to the 1-yard line on first down, but he and Tony Hunt failed to score on second and third down. Andy Reid went for it on fourth down and Buckhalter was stuffed for no gain. The Bears killed most of the clock on their next drive and the Eagles fell 24-20.  McNabb threw for 262 yards.  Reggie Brown had 6 catches for 79 yards.  The loss made the Eagles 2-2.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total points were scored in the game?",
