    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn 2007, the CFTCs  budget was $98 million and it had 437 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). After 2008, funding increased by 80% to $205 million and 687 FTEs for fiscal year (FY) 2012, but was cut to $180.4 million and 682 FTEs for FY 2013. In 2013 CFTCs performance was severely affected by limited resources and had to delay cases. The current, FY 2014 funding of $215m did not keep up with CFTCs increasing swaps market oversight and regulation, equivalent to tens of trillions of dollars in formerly dark market trading, according to outgoing Commissioner Bart Chilton in his last speech. The Obama administrations latest budget proposal for FY 2015 requested $280m, which is $35m less than the request for the previous year, and would fund \"100 less employees than we need\" per Chilton, who called the budget \"woefully insufficient\" for CFTCs more than 40-fold increased purview. In February 2014, Commissioner Scott D. OMalia dissented from the FY 2014 spending plan saying that it did not allocate enough funding to new technology investments, but allocated too much to swap dealer oversight, duplicating the work of the self-regulatory National Futures Association. In March he dissented from the FY 2015 budget request stating CFTC \"makes an unrealistic request for new staff and funding in this budget request without a firm understanding of its mission priorities, specific goals, and corresponding personnel and technology needs.\"\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more million dollars was the CFTCs budget in 2008 than in 2007?",
