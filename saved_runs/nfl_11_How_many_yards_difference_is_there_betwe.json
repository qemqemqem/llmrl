    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing of their road win over the Rams, the Cardinals went home for an NFC West rematch with the Seattle Seahawks.  In the first quarter, the Cards drew first blood with QB Matt Leinart completing a 56-yard TD pass to WR Bryant Johnson, while RB Edgerrin James (who ran for 115 yards on the day) got a 7-yard TD run.  The Seahawks would respond with QB Matt Hasselbeck's 23-yard TD pass to WR D.J. Hackett.  In the second quarter, the Big Red increased its lead with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 32-yard field goal, yet Seattle responded with Hasselbeck's 5-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson.  In the third quarter, Arizona temporarily lost the lead as Hasselbeck completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson for the only score of the period.  Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, Arizona reclaimed the lead and won with Leinart's 5-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald and Rackers' 40-yard field goal.  With the upset win, the Cardinals improved to 4-9.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards difference is there between the top two longest touchdown passes?",
