He recorded a one-hit, 14-strikeout complete game shutout on May 25, 2001.  On Aug. 3, 2001, he struck out nine batters and gave up only one run over eight innings to defeat Chan Ho Park and the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-1 to extend the Cubs lead in National League Central to 3.5 games.   The following season, Wood finished 12-11 with a 3.67 ERA, and did not miss a start all year long, setting career highs with 213.6 innings pitched and 33 starts. He had 217 strikeouts in both seasons.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points higher was Wood's ERA is 2002 compared to 2001?",
