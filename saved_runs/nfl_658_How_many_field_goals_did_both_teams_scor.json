    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Dolphins began their 2007 campaign on the road against the Washington Redskins. After a scoreless first quarter, the Redskins made the first move with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 31-yard field goal three minutes into the second quarter. Miami took the lead before the end of the half with a one-yard touchdown pass from Trent Green to tight end Justin Peelle as time expired. Washington took a 10-7 lead on a 19-yard Clinton Portis touchdown run with just under 12 minutes remaining in the third quarter.  Dolphins kicker Jay Feely tied the game at 10 later in the quarter on a 20-yard field goal, and each team notched another field goal in the fourth quarter. With four seconds remaining and the ball on the Washington 43-yard line, Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell launched a last-second Hail Mary pass that was batted by Dolphins defensive end Jason Taylor in the end zone. Redskins wide receiver Antwaan Randle El caught the ball at the six but was tackled at the three-yard line before he could score the winning touchdown. The Redskins won the coin toss to begin overtime and promptly mounted a 10-play, 62-yard drive that included just two passes. Suisham made his third field goal of the game, this time from 39 yards out, to win the game 16-13 and hand Miami their first loss of the season as they started out 0-1 and 0-1 against NFC Opponents.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did both teams score in the fourth quarter?",
