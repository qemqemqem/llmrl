    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Falcons, the Panthers flew to Lambeau Field for a Week 13 duel with the Green Bay Packers.  In the first quarter, Carolina pounced first as RB DeAngelo Williams got a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Packers responded with kicker Mason Crosby getting a 32-yard field goal.  The Panthers would answer with QB Jake Delhomme getting a 1-yard TD run.  Green Bay replied with QB Aaron Rodgers completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Donald Driver, yet Carolina ended the half with Williams getting another 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Packers tied the game as Crosby made a 44-yard field goal, while Rodgers completed a 5-yard TD pass to TE Donald Lee (along with a successful 2-point conversion pass to WR Greg Jennings).  In the fourth quarter, Green Bay took the lead as Rodgers hooked up with Jennings on a 21-yard TD pass, yet the Panthers answered with Williams getting his third 1-yard TD run.  The Packers would retake the lead as Crosby nailed a 19-yard field goal, yet Carolina sealed the victory with Williams getting his fourth 1-yard TD run (setting the single-game franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Aaron Rodgers longest touchdown pass than this shortest?",
