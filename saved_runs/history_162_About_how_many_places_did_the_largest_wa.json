    "problem_text": "Context:\nAccording to available information, the about 1,000 refugees from the Hamidian massacres  mainly originated from Diyarbakir , Aintab and Kilis; only about 100 of them stayed. The next wave of Armenian refugees were the about 2,000 who fled the Adana massacre in 1909, most of whom returned to their ancestral homes in Adana within the same year. However, the largest wave of Armenian refugees - some of whom had come before and returned - were the nearly 9,000 who escaped the massive deportations, the horrific massacres and the Genocide perpetrated by the Ottomans and the Young Turks; about 1,300 of them decided to stay, while the others eventually made arrangements to settle in other countries. Those refugees came mainly from Adana and Seleucia , while there a significant number of them came from Sis, Marash, Tarsus, Caesarea, Hadjin and Aintab; smaller numbers came from other places, alphabetically: Adapazar, Adrianople , Afion-Karahisar, Alexandretta , Arapgir, Armash, Baghche, Bardizag, Balian Dagh, Biredjik, Bitlis, Brusa, Chemishgezek, Constantinople , D\u00f6rtyol, Edessa ,  Erzerum, Eskishehir, Everek, Ikonion , Jeyhan, Kesab, Kharpert, Kutahia, Malatia, Mersin, Misis, Musa Dagh , Nicomedia , Rhaedestos , Sasun, Sebastia , Shar, Sivri Hisar, Smyrna , Tokat , Trepizond, Van, Yerzinga, Yozgat and Zeitun.\n\nQuestion:\nAbout how many places did the largest wave of refugees come from?",
