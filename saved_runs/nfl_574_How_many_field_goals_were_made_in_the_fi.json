    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their Monday Night loss to the Packers, the Broncos flew to Ford Field for a Week 9 interconference duel with the Detroit Lions.  In the first quarter, Denver trailed early as Lions kicker Jason Hanson managed to get a 43-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Broncos continued to struggle as Hanson gave Detroit a 53-yard field goal, while QB Jon Kitna completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Mike Furrey.  The Lions would end the half with Hanson kicking a 38-yard field goal.  Even worse, starting QB Jay Cutler (3/4 for 20 yards) would leave the game with a lower left leg injury. In the third quarter, Detroit continued to destroy Denver as DE Dewayne White returned a fumble 3 yards for a touchdown, while Kitna completed a 49-yard TD pass to WR Shaun McDonald.  In the fourth quarter, the Lions finished their job as NT Shaun Rogers returned an interception 66 yards for a touchdown, while RB T. J. Duckett got a 3-yard TD run.  The Broncos prevented a shutout when QB Patrick Ramsey completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley. This would be the second time this year that the Broncos lost by at least 37 points.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were made in the first half?",
