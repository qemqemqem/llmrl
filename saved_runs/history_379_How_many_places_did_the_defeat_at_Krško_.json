    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn 5 February, Uskok captain and baron Jobst Joseph von Thurn  led an army of 500 Uskoks from Kostanjevica and some German soldiers that defeated a rebel detachment of Nikola Kupini\u010d at Kr\u0161ko , which was the first larger rebel defeat. This rapidly weakened the rebellion in Carniola and Styria. The next day, another rebel force was defeated near Samobor. On 9 February, the decisive Battle of Stubi\u010dko polje was fought. Gubec and his 10,000 men resisted fiercely, but after a bloody four-hour battle the baronal army defeated and captured Gubec. The revolt failed. Retribution was brutal: in addition to the 3,000 peasants who died in the battle, many captives were hanged or maimed. Matija Gubec was publicly tortured and executed on 15 February. Officers Petar Ljubojevi\u0107, Vuk Sukovi\u0107 and Dane Bol\u010deta , and Juraj Martijanovi\u0107 and Tomo Torti\u0107  were all sentenced to life in prison and lost all their property. Mogai\u0107 was killed in the final battle, and Pasanec was most probably killed in one of the skirmishes in early February, while Gregori\u0107 managed to escape, but was captured within weeks, brought to Vienna for interrogation, and executed in Zagreb in 1574.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many places did the defeat at Kr\u0161ko weaken the rebellion of?",
