WHO asserts that a water level of 0.01 mg/L (10 ppb) poses a risk of 6 in 10000 chance of lifetime skin cancer risk and contends that this level of risk is acceptable.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more mg/L is highest amount of arsenic in drinking water linked to skin cancer risk than the lowest mg/L amount?",
