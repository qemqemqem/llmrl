In the first quarter, the Jets grabbed an early lead as Nick Folk kicked a field goal from 45 yards out for a 3-0 lead.  The Raiders took the lead later on in the quarter as Derek Carr found Rod Streater on a 12-yard touchdown pass for a 7-3 game.  In the 2nd quarter, the Jets retook the lead when Geno Smith found Chris Johnson on a 5-yard touchdown pass for a 10-7 game at halftime.  After the break, the Jets went back to work as Folk kicked another field goal from 42 yards out for a 13-7 game for that quarter's only score.  In the 4th quarter, they increased their lead as Chris Ivory ran for a 71-yard touchdown (with a faild 2-point conversion) for a 19-7 game.  The Raiders scored late in the 4th quarter when Carr found James Jones on a 30-yard touchdown pass for a 19-14 final score.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Jets lead by at halftime?",
