The Chargers' home crowd of 53,832 was their lowest since 2004. It was their third-straight blackout at home and fourth of the season. With the way ticket sales have been going, San Diego's home finale against the Raiders is expected to sell out, thus ending the home blackout streak. The team finished the season 0-4 against NFC opponents and had their first losing season since 2003.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years ago Chargers were in playoff contention?",
