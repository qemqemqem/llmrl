    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Jets wore New York Titans throwback uniforms for an AFL Legacy Game with the Tennessee Titans, who wore 1960s Houston Oilers uniforms. The game was originally scheduled for a 4:15 PM start time but due to the Jewish holiday at sundown, Woody Johnson wrote a letter to the NFL asking to move the game to a 1:00 PM start time so more people could attend the game. New York would take flight in the first quarter with rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez getting a 14-yard touchdown run. And later in the first he completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Ben Hartsock.  The Titans would answer in the second quarter with running back LenDale White's 5-yard touchdown run and kicker Rob Bironas' 38-yard field goal. This made the score 14-10 with the Jets leading. Tennessee would take the lead in the third quarter with quarterback Kerry Collins' 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Nate Washington, yet the Jets came right back with Sanchez's 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery.  In the fourth quarter, New York would add onto their lead with a 30-yard field goal from kicker Jay Feely.  Afterwards, the defense would prevent any possible comeback attempts from the Titans. With the win, not only did the Jets improve to 3-0, but Sanchez (17-of-30, 171 yards, 2 TDs, 1 INT) would become the first rookie quarterback since the AFL-NFL merger of 1970 to win their first three games.  Also, this marked the first time since 2004 that New York began a season at 3-0.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was the field goal in the first half compared to the second half?",
