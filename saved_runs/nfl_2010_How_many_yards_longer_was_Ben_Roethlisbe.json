The difference between 22 and 16 is 6, so the answer is 6 yards. Since there were only two values to subtract, this was a straightforward problem. However, if there were more values to subtract, it would be helpful to organize the information in a table or list to avoid confusion.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye week, the Raiders flew to Heinz Field for a Week 11 duel with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Oakland delivered the game's opening punch in the first quarter with a 41-yard field goal from kicker Sebastian Janikowski.  The Steelers answered with running back Rashard Mendenhall getting a 5-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger getting a 16-yard touchdown run, followed by his 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Raiders' deficit increased in the fourth quarter as Roethlisberger completed a 52-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace, followed by running back Isaac Redman getting a 16-yard touchdown pass. There were several fights during the game, mentioned by the commentators as \"reminiscent of the seventies\" (the Raiders and Steelers were bitter rivals in the 1970s). The first incident came before the kickoff. Defensive tackle Richard Seymour was ejected from the game after punching Roethlisberger in the face through the facemask late in the first half.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Ben Roethlisberger's touchdown pass than his touchdown run in the first half?",
