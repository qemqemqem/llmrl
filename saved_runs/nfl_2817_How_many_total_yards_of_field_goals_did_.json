    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter tough losses at home, the Raiders traveled to Cleveland to take on the Browns.  The Browns scored 9 straight points leading into the 2nd quarter when Billy Cundiff kicked 3 field goals from:  52 (in the 1st quarter), 33, and 26 yards out (in the 2nd quarter) for leads of 3-0, 6-0, and 9-0.  The Raiders got on the board when Sebastian Janikowski kicked 2 field goals before halftime from 46 and 38 yards out for a 9-3 and then 9-6 game at halftime.  After a scoreless 3rd quarter, the Browns got back to work in the 4th when Brian Hoyer found Andrew Hawkins on a 4-yard touchdown pass for a 16-6 lead followed by Ben Tate running in the end zone for a 5-yard touchdown for a 23-6 game.  The Raiders wrapped up the scoring of the game later on when Derek Carr found Andre Holmes 10-yard touchdown pass for the final score:  23-13.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards of field goals did Sebastian Janikowski make?",
