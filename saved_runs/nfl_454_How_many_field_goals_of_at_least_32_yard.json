    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a three-game skid, the Falcons went home and played a Week 9 interconference duel with the San Francisco 49ers. In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as 49ers RB Maurice Hicks got a 9-yard TD run. The Falcons responded with RB Warrick Dunn getting a 9-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Atlanta increased its lead with RB Ovie Mughelli getting a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, San Francisco crept close as kicker Joe Nedney got a 49-yard and a 32-yard field goal.  Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Falcons answered with kicker Morten Andersen getting a 33-yard field goal. The 49ers responded with Nedney kicking a 22-yard field goal, yet Atlanta got the win with Andersen nailing a 27-yard field goal. The struggling Falcons rushing attack had its best performance (to date) with 155 total rushing yards.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals of at least 32 yards did Joe Nedney kick in the third quarter?",
