    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn cities with indoor smoking bans, hookah bars have been forced to close or switch to tobacco-free mixtures. In many cities though, hookah lounges have been growing in popularity. From the year 2000 to 2004, over 200 new hookah caf\u00e9s opened for business, most of them targeted at young adults and located near college campuses or cities with large Middle-Eastern communities. This activity continues to gain popularity within the post-secondary student demographic. Hookah use among high school students rose from 4.1% to 9.4% from 2011 to 2014 while cigarette smoking decreased from 15.8% to 9.2% during this same time period, according to the US CDC. According to a 2011 study, 40.3 percent of college and university students surveyed had smoked tobacco from a hookah. As of 8 July 2013, at least 1,178 college or university campuses in the U.S. have adopted 100% smokefree campus policies that attempt to eliminate smoking in indoor and outdoor areas across the entire campus, including residences.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percent of college students claim to have never used a hookah in 2011?",
