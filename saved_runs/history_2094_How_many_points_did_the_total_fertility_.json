The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2010 was 2.05 children per woman, in 2011 2.02. The crude birth rate in 2010 ranged from 11.5 in Marmara Region (TFR 1.52) (11,5;1.55 in 2011), similar to Bulgaria, to 27.9 in Southeastern Anatolia Region (TFR 3.53) (27.1;3,42 in 2011), similar to Syria. Similarly, in 2012, the TFR ranged from 1.43 in K\u0131rklareli, to 4.39 in \u015eanl\u0131urfa. Deaths statistics from MERNIS are available as of 2009.
