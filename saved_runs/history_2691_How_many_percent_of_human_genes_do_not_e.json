The correct answer is that 5% of human genes do not encode more than one protein. I arrived at this answer by using the information provided in the context, which states that TP53 is one of the 95% of human genes that encodes more than one protein. Therefore, the remaining 5% of human genes do not encode more than one protein.

In 2005 several protein isoform were discovered and until now, 12 human p53 isoforms were identified (p53\u03b1, p53\u03b2, p53\u03b3, \u220640p53\u03b1, \u220640p53\u03b2, \u220640p53\u03b3, \u2206133p53\u03b1, \u2206133p53\u03b2, \u2206133p53\u03b3, \u2206160p53\u03b1, \u2206160p53\u03b2, \u2206160p53\u03b3). Furthermore, p53 isoforms are expressed in a tissue dependent manner and p53\u03b1 is never expressed alone.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percent of human genes do not encodes more than one protein?",
