    "problem_text": "Context:\nAttempting to capitalize on their decisive victory at Atlanta, a revitalized Saints team entered the game with high hopes.  In the first quarter, 49ers kicker Joe Nedney kicked a 29-yarder for the 49ers only score of the half. Reggie Bush exploded in the second quarter with a 1-yard run touchdown and, after an interception returned to the 7-yard line by Mike McKenzie, a sneak-around touchdown late in the quarter.  Coming into the third quarter, Alex Smith completed a 48-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Bryant, but that was the final score for the 49ers. After a John Carney field goal, Reggie Bush took hold of a five-yard shovel pass from Drew Brees and scored his third touchdown of the night.  In the fourth quarter, Bush ran down the sidelines and appeared to be heading for a fourth touchdown after a quick pass that he turned into a 74-yarder, but he fumbled the ball out of bounds.  However, he scored on a ten-yard run a few plays later, and kicker John Carney sent the game away with a 33-yard field goal.  With the win, the Saints improve to 8-4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did John Carney kick in the game?",
