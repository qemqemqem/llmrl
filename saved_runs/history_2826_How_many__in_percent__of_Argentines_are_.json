To correctly answer the question, we need to add up the percentages of the population that are practicing Catholics, Muslims, and Protestants, which is 20% + 1.5% + the percentage of Protestants who regularly attend services. As the context states that a majority of Protestants regularly attend services, we can assume that this percentage is greater than 50%. Therefore, the total percentage of religious people in Argentina is approximately 89%. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the context more carefully and paid closer attention to the percentages provided.

The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are practicing regularly or weekly at a church service. The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003. Islam in Argentina number about 500,000-600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni. Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A recent study found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many, in percent, of Argentines are religious?",
