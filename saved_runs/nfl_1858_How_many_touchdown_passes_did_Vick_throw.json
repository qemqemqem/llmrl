    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Packers began their season at Lincoln Financial Field against the Philadelphia Eagles, who were wearing throwback uniforms commemorating the 50th anniversary of the teams' victory over the Packers in the 1960 NFL Championship Game.  Green Bay trailed in the first quarter as Eagles kicker David Akers made a 45-yard field goal.  The Packers would then take control in the second quarter as kicker Mason Crosby nailed a 49-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Aaron Rodgers completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver.  Crosby would then end the half with a 56-yard field goal. Eagles starting quarterback Kevin Kolb left the game with concussion at halftime, and was replaced by second-string quarterback Michael Vick for the remainder of the contest. Philadelphia would respond in the third quarter as running back LeSean McCoy scored on a 12-yard touchdown run, yet Green Bay came right back with Rodgers finding wide receiver Greg Jennings on a 32-yard touchdown pass.  The Eagles tried to rally in the fourth quarter as quarterback Michael Vick completed a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeremy Maclin, followed by a 24-yard field goal from Akers.  Fortunately, the Packers' defense prevented any further progress stopping Michael Vick on a key 4th and 1 rush up the middle for no gain. With the win, Green Bay not only began its season at 1-0, but also got its first victory in Philadelphia since 1962. However, the Packers victory was not without cost. During the game, Justin Harrell injured his ACL and Ryan Grant injured his ankle. Both players were placed on injured reserve for the rest season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes did Vick throw?",
