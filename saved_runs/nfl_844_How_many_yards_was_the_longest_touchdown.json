    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill trying to get their first win of the year, the Rams flew to Qwest Field for a Week 7 divisional duel with the Seattle Seahawks.  In the first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Seahawks QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Will Heller.  The Rams would reply with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 31-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Seahawks increased its lead with kicker Josh Brown getting a 38-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, Seattle flew further into the lead with WR Nate Burleson returning the half's opening kickoff 91&#160;yards for a touchdown.  St. Louis would answer with Wilkins kicking a 29-yard field goal, yet the Seahawks continued its domination with Brown kicking a 48-yard and a 45-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Seattle sealed the win with Brown getting a 43-yard field goal, while Hasselbeck and Heller hooked up with each other again on an 11-yard TD pass. With the loss, the Rams fell to 0-7 for the first time in franchise history.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown pass?",
