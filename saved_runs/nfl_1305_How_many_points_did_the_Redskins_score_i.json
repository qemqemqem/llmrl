After a scoreless first half, the Redskins scored in the third quarter on a Clinton Portis 3-yard TD run.  The Browns responded when kicker Phil Dawson made a 37-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Washington increased its lead as QB Jason Campbell completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss. After falling behind 14-3, Cleveland staged a late rally with QB Derek Anderson completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR Joshua Cribbs and a successful 2-point conversion pass to WR Braylon Edwards. The Browns had a chance to tie the score in the final seconds of the game, however, Phil Dawson's 54-yard field goal attempt went wide right and the Redskins prevailed.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Redskins score in the third quarter?",
