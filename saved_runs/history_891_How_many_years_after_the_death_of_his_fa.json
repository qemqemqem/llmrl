At least two of Laestadius's own sons predeceased him as well . Around 1833 Laestadius suffered from an ailment which the doctors first thought was pneumonia. He recovered. In the 1840s, Laestadius suffered from severe typhoid fever and later tuberculosis.  Towards the end of his life, Laestadius experienced \"impending blindness\" and contracted a cholera-like illness.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after the death of his father, did his brother Petrus die?",
