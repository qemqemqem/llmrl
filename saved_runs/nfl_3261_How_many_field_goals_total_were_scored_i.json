    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn the first quarter Carolina and New York scored only a field goal each. In the second quarter, Cam Newton scored a 1 yard touchdown but Graham Gano missed the extra point. Gano redeemed himself with another field goal, giving the Panthers a nine-point lead. Robby Anderson caught a 33-yard pass from Josh McCown, plus the extra point from Chandler Catanzaro, and Carolina led, 12-10. In the third New York scored a touchdown, and Jets led by 17-12. But Carolina answered with a Jonathan Stewart touchdown and took a 18-17 lead. Early in the fourth Catanzaro kicked a field goal, putting the Jets back on top, 20-18. Later the Panthers blitzed McCown and forced a fumble, which was recovered by Luke Kuechly who recovered it for a 34-yard touchdown. The Jets punted after their next drive fizzled and Kaelin Clay returned it 60 yards, making the score 32-20. Jermaine Kearse scored a touchdown for the Jets, and Catanzaro's extra point cut the Panthers' lead to 5. With 5:11 to go in the fourth quarter, Gano kicked a field goal and Carolina won by a final score of 35-27. The Panthers record improved to 8-3. Their win knocked the Jets out of playoff contention.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals total were scored in the first quarter?",
