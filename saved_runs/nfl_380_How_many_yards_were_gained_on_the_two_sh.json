I then focused on the first quarter and found that RB LaDainian Tomlinson scored two touchdowns, one for 2 yards and the other for 38 yards. However, the question asked for the yardage gained on the two shortest touchdown runs in the first two quarters. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 yards for the first touchdown run and 3 yards for the second touchdown run. To solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully and paid attention to the specific details being asked for.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off of their bye week, the Rams flew to Qualcomm Stadium for their Week 8 match-up with the San Diego Chargers.  From the get-go, St. Louis trailed as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 2-yard TD run and a 38-yard TD run in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, the Rams started to retaliate as RB Steven Jackson got a 3-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the third quarter, things started to get ugly for St. Louis as Chargers free safety Marlon McCree returned a fumble 79 yards for a touchdown. The Rams responded with kicker Jeff Wilkins nailing a 34-yard field goal, yet Chargers kicker Nate Kaeding made a 31-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, it was back and forth with touchdowns.  San Diego RB Michael Turner got a 14-yard TD run, while Rams QB Marc Bulger completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Shaun McDonald.  Afterwards, Chargers QB Philip Rivers completed a 25-yard TD pass to Tomlinson, while Bulger completed a 6-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Curtis. However, San Diego got the win, as St. Louis fell to 4-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards were gained on the two shortest touchdown runs in the first two quarters?",
