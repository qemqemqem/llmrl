    "problem_text": "Context:\nAgainst the Tennessee Titans, the Bears recorded a franchise record 28 points in the first quarter. The Bears defense recorded five turnovers; Charles Tillman recorded four forced fumbles by stripping Kenny Britt and Jared Cook once, and Chris Johnson twice (a league first), while Brian Urlacher recorded an interception. The Bears scored the first touchdown of the game when Sherrick McManis blocked Brett Kern's punt, which was recovered by Corey Wootton, who returned the blocked punt five yards for his first career touchdown. The Titans later recorded a safety when J'Marcus Webb was penalized for illegal-hands-to-the-face while blocking in the end zone. The Bears then scored on Matt Forte's eight-yard run, followed by Urlacher intercepting Matt Hasselbeck and returning the pick for another touchdown. Jay Cutler later hit Brandon Marshall to end the quarter with the Bears leading 28-2. The Bears became the first team in league history to score a touchdown pass, a touchdown run, an interception returned for a touchdown, and a kick/punt blocked for a score in a quarter. Titans kicker Rob Bironas later ended the half on a 39-yard field goal. The Titans would finally score a touchdown on Hasselbeck's 30-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington in the third quarter. After Robbie Gould's three field goals, the Bears scored two more touchdowns on Cutler's passes to Marshall. With ten minutes left in the game, Johnson scored on an 80-yard run to narrow the score to 51-20, but the game would still be out of reach for the Titans. With the win, the Bears improved to 7-1. The 51 points scored by the Bears were the most by the team since the 1980 victory over the Green Bay Packers, when the team triumphed 61-7. The points scored were also the highest by the Bears in a road game since their 1963 win over the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 52-14. In addition, Urlacher was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Week while McManis was named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week.  It was the first time teammates have won weekly awards since 2008.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points total were scored in the game?",
