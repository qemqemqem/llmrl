    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their home win over the Bengals, the Chiefs flew to McAfee Coliseum for a Week 7 AFC West duel with their arch-enemy, the Oakland Raiders.  In the first quarter, Kansas City drew first blood with kicker Dave Rayner getting a 41-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 31-yard field goal in the second quarter.  In the third quarter, the Raiders took the lead with QB Daunte Culpepper completing a 21-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, K.C. regained the lead with RB Larry Johnson getting a 1-yard TD pass (with a failed 2-point conversion).  Oakland managed to get within striking distance as kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 37-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Raiders tried to get into position to win the game.  Fortunately, Kansas City's defense eliminated any hope that Oakland had of winning. With the win, not only did the Chiefs improve to 4-3 heading into their bye week, but it also marked their 9th-straight win over their hated rival.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were scored in the second quarter?",
