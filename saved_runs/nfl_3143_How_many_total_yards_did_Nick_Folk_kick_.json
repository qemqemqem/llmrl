    "problem_text": "Context:\nFor their home opener, the Lions hosted the Tennessee Titans. The Lions had led for most of the game, accumulating 12 points in the first half with an end zone tackle of DeMarco Murray by Devin Taylor for a safety, a 24-yard touchdown catch by Anquan Boldin from Matthew Stafford, and a 42-yard Matt Prater field goal, while holding the Titans to only a 46-yard field goal by Ryan Succop before the break. Detroit lost steam after intermission and only managed to score a single 27-yard Prater field goal in the third quarter. After Tennessee gained a 16-15 lead late in the fourth quarter on touchdown passes from Marcus Mariota to Delanie Walker and Andre Johnson, from 30 and nine-yards respectively, an attempted Detroit comeback failed when Matthew Stafford was picked off by Perrish Cox in the closing seconds, giving the Lions their first loss of the season. The game was marred by 29 penalties, 17 on the Lions. Detroit had three touchdowns (two on the same drive) called back due to penalties.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards did Nick Folk kick for field goals?",
