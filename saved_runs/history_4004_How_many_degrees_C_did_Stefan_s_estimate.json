The temperature Stefan obtained was a median value of previous ones, 1950 \u00b0C and the absolute thermodynamic one 2200 K. As 2.574  43.5, it follows from the law that the temperature of the Sun is 2.57 times greater than the temperature of the lamella, so Stefan got a value of 5430 \u00b0C or 5700 K (the modern value is 5778 K). This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun. Before this, values ranging from as low as 1800 \u00b0C to as high as 13,000,000 \u00b0C were claimed. The lower value of 1800 \u00b0C was determined by Claude Pouillet (1790\u20131868) in 1838 using the Dulong\u2013Petit law. Pouillet also took just half the value of the Suns correct energy flux.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many degrees C did Stefan's estimate vary from Claude's?",
