    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Bengals started the season at home against the Ravens.  In the first quarter, the Ravens scored as Justin Tucker kicked a 25-yard field goal to make it 3-0.  They would increase their lead in the second quarter when Joe Flacco found Jeremy Maclin on a 48-yard pass to make it 10-0.  This would be followed up by a 2-yard touchdown run by Terrence West to make the score 17-0 at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Ravens would go back to work with Tucker kicking yet another 25-yard field goal to make the score 20-0.  A scoreless fourth quarter made this the eventual final score of the game. With the loss, the Bengals started their season 0-1.  This is the team's first shut-out loss at home since 2001. Andy Dalton set a new career high for total turnovers in a game with 5 (4 interceptions, 1 lost fumble)\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points were scored in the first quarter?",
