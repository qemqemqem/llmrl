He completed a degree in Physiotherapy at University College Dublin in 1988. He is the son of Irish language publisher and author P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Snodaigh and artist Cliodhna Cussen. His brothers are Fergus, Aengus, Cormac, R\u00f3n\u00e1n and Rossa. His great uncle Dennis Cussen ran in the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, in the 100 yards competition, held the world record for fastest time over 100 yards on grass for a time and also played rugby for Ireland 15 times scoring a famous hat-trick of tries against England in 1926.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years pass between Cussen's famous hat-trick of tries against England and Cussen running in the Olympics?",
