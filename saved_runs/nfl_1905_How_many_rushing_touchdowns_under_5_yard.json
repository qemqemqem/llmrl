    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the Raiders the Chiefs flew to INVESCO Field at Mile High for a division rivalry match against the Broncos. In the first quarter the Chiefs immediately struggled with QB Kyle Orton making 17, 8 and 40-yard TD passes to WR Knowshon Moreno, WR Brandon Lloyd and WR Jabar Gaffney respectively. This was followed by Tim Tebow getting a 1-yard TD run, and with OLB Jason Hunter recovering a fumble and running 75 yards for a touchdown. The Chiefs tried to come back when QB Matt Cassel made a 5-yard TD pass to RB Jamaal Charles, followed by kicker Ryan Succop hitting a 40-yard field goal. The Chiefs struggled further as Tebow got a 3-yard TD pass to FB Spencer Larsen. They answered with Cassel's 15-yard TD pass to Bowe. The Broncos continued to score in the 4th quarter with Orton making a 15-yard TD pass to Lloyd. The Chiefs tried narrow the lead with Cassel making an 11 and a 22-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers and Dwayne Bowe respectively (With failed 2-point conversions for each), but the defense prevented their chances.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many rushing touchdowns under 5 yards were scored in the game?",
