    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Saints, the Jets flew to Land Shark Stadium for a Week 5 Monday Night duel with their AFC East rival, the Miami Dolphins.  New York immediately trailed as the Dolphins took the game's opening drive and capped it off with a 1-yard touchdown run from running Ronnie Brown.  The Jets immediately responded with rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to newly acquired wide receiver Braylon Edwards.  Afterwards, Miami closed out the opening quarter with a 35-yard field goal from kicker Dan Carpenter.  In the second quarter, New York took the lead as kicker Jay Feely got a 40-yard and a 43-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, both the Jets and the Dolphins would get involved in a back-and-forth fourth quarter.  Miami opened up the period with quarterback Chad Henne hooking up with tight end Anthony Fasano on a 2-yard touchdown pass, while New York got a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Thomas Jones.  The Dolphins would immediately respond as Henne threw a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr., but Jones came through again with a 3-yard touchdown run.  Late in the game, Miami managed to crack through the Jets' defense as Brown got a 2-yard touchdown run.  New York tried to rally, but Sanchez's last-second hail mary pass was knocked away.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were longer than 50 yards long?",
