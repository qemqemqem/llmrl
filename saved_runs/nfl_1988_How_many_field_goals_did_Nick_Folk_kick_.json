In the first quarter, the Jets took the early lead with kicker Nick Folk hitting a 23-yard field goal. Then he nailed a 28-yard field goal in the second quarter to bring the Jets up 6-0. After that, the Ravens replied and took the lead when RB Willis McGahee completed a 1-yard TD run. The Ravens extended their lead in the third quarter when kicker Billy Cundiff got a 25-yard field goal. The Jets cut the lead in the fourth quarter with Folk making a 48-yard field goal, but it wasn't enough, giving the Jets a loss.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Nick Folk kick?",
