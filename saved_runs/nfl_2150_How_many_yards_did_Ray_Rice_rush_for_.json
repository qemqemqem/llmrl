Two plays later Joe Flacco threw a 27-yard strike to Anquan Boldin, giving the Ravens a lead they would never relinquish.Defense would be the story of this game, however, as Terrell Suggs strip-sacked Ben Roethlisberger during the Steelers second possession and Haloti Ngata recovered at the Pittsburgh 37-yard line.  Suggs ended the game with 3 sacks and the Ravens forced 7 turnovers. With the win not only did the Ravens improve to 1-0, but they handed the Steelers their first opening day loss since 2002.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did Ray Rice rush for?",
