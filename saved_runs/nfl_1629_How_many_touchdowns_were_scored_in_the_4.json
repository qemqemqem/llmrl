    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe 49ers flew to Arizona for a week 1 opener against the team that had swept them the previous season. 49ers quarterback Shaun Hill made his season-opening debut, hoping to redeem himself for letting a close game slip through his fingers the previous year. The first half was largely a defensive struggle. With 5:26 remaining in the first half Frank Gore, the 49ers feature back and offensive focal point the last three seasons, had been held to negative one yard rushing on six carries. Arizona's offense, known in 2008 for their great passing attack, was forced to punt after going 3 and out on three separate occasions, was held to only 3 first downs, and turned the ball over once on an interception by Patrick Willis at this point in the game. After trading field goals, the 49ers were up 6-3 when Frank Gore pounded his way through for a 6-yard score. Cardinals kicker Neil Rackers would kick a 45-yard field goal to close out the first half to make the score 13-6. In the third quarter, Kurt Warner led the Cardinals on a long drive capped off with a quick touchdown pass to Larry Fitzgerald, a score that would tie the game at 13-13. Despite the small momentum the 49ers had gained by the end of the first half, in the third quarter the 49ers were held to all of 4&#160;yards total Offense. All of the momentum was going Arizona's way after forcing the 49ers to zero first downs and three punts in as many drives. Not long thereafter, the Cardinals took the lead with a Rackers field goal to get the score to 16-13.In 4th quarter, Shaun Hill lifted his demons by responding on the following drive leading the 49ers offense on a long drive lasting 15 plays that was capped off with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Frank Gore. More tension was yet to come as the 49ers defense stopped the Cardinals hurry-up offense on two consecutive drives, one ending on a failed 4th and 5 from the 49ers 33&#160;yard line with 1:51 left in the game. After forcing the Cardinals to burn up their final two time outs with consecutive runs the 49ers were forced to punt giving Arizona one last chance with only 43 seconds left to play from their own 12. Defensive end Justin Smith would make the game winning sack. With the win, led primarily by the 49ers outstanding defensive effort, the 49ers started their season 1-0. Wide receiver Isaac Bruce (4 receptions, 74&#160;yards) would join Jerry Rice as the only receivers to surpass 15,000 career receiving yards.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were scored in the 4th quarter?",
