I misunderstood the problem and calculated the percentage of white students out of the total student population, rather than the percentage more of white students compared to international students. To solve the problem correctly, we need to subtract the percentage of international students from the percentage of white students and express the result as a percentage of the percentage of international students. Using this method, we get:\n\nPercentage more of white students compared to international students = ((69.4 - 3.8) / 3.8) x 100% = 1,727.37%\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the problem more carefully and made sure I understood what was being asked before attempting to solve it.",

The student body has members from every Louisiana parish, 47 U.S. states, and 64 foreign countries. Louisiana residents account for 85.0% of the student population, while out-of-state students and international students account for 11.1% and 4.0% of the student body, respectively. The student body at Louisiana Tech is 69.4% white, 13.3% black, 3.8% international students, and 13.5% other or \"unknown\" ethnicity. The student body consists of 50.2% women and 49.8% men.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percent more of students identify as white as opposed to international?",
