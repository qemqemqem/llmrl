    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game losing streak, the Browns flew to Soldier Field for a Week 8 interconference duel with the Chicago Bears. The Browns' defense held up well early, limiting the Bears to three field goals by kicker Robbie Gould (a 37-yard & a 29-yard in the first quarter and a 32-yard in the second). However, the Browns could not manage to get on the board and Chicago RB Matt Forte scored on a 1-yard run, putting the Browns down 16 at the half. The Browns struck first in the third quarter on a one-yard run by QB Derek Anderson, but the PAT was blocked. Forte scored again in the third with a 10-yard touchdown run and the Bears put the Browns away with a 21-yard interception return for a touchdown by CB Charles Tillman in the fourth quarter. Late in the fourth, Derek Anderson was benched for Brady Quinn after going 6 of 17 (35.2%) for 76 yards and 2 interceptions. With the loss, the Browns went into their bye week at 1-7. On November 2, the Browns fired general manager George Kokinis after getting off to a disappointing 1-7 start. The Browns' statement said that Kokinis \"is no longer actively involved with the organization.\" Owner Randy Lerner reportedly asked for his resignation, and when Kokinis refused, sought a dismissal \"for cause.\" Head coach Eric Mangini was told by Lerner that his job was safe for the moment.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many defensive touchdowns were scored in the game?",
