To correctly answer the question, I should have gone through the list of tournaments Timman won and counted how many times he won two tournaments in the same year. By doing so, I would have found that Timman won two tournaments in the same year in 1981, 1984, and 1989. Therefore, the correct answer is 3.

In the 1980s he won a number of very strong tournaments, including Amsterdam IBM in 1981, Wijk aan Zee 1981, and 1985, Linares chess tournament 1988, the 1989 Max Euwe Memorial, and the 1989 World Cup tournament in Rotterdam. Other major successes included Las Palmas 1981, Mar del Plata chess tournaments 1982, Bugojno 1984, and Sarajevo 1984. One of his notable later successes was the 2nd Immopar Fast chess Tournament in 1991, a weekend event which attracted a huge amount of prize money. In this knock-out format tournament he defeated Gata Kamsky 1\u00bd-\u00bd, Karpov 2-0, Viswanathan Anand 1\u00bd-\u00bd, and finally the World Champion Garry Kasparov 1\u00bd-\u00bd to win the first prize of approximately 75,000 USD. His performance was equivalent to an Elo rating of 2950.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many different years did Timman win two tournaments in the same year?",
