    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Buccaneers hosted division rival Atlanta, wearing their orange throwback uniforms. Tied 7-7 in the second quarter, Matt Ryan completed a 17-yard touchdown pass to Ovie Mughelli and a 14-7 Atlanta lead. With two minutes left in the first half, Ryan was intercepted by Sean Jones. With 15 seconds left in the half, Josh Freeman threw a touchdown pass to Mike Williams, to tie the score at 14-14. Connor Barth kicked a 33-yard field goal, and Tampa Bay took a 17-14 lead in the third quarter. With 12:33 left in the game, Corey Lynch intercepted Matt Ryan. The turnover led to a 2-yard touchdown pass to John Gilmore, and Tampa Bay led 24-14 with 10:24 remaining. Eric Weems returned the ensuing kickoff 102 yards for a touchdown. That trimmed the lead to 24-21. On Atlanta's next drive, Ronde Barber was called for pass interference, and Quincy Black was penalized for a \"horse-collar tackle.\" Atlanta quickly scored a 9-yard touchdown pass to Michael Jenkins, and took a 28-24 lead with 4:31 left. Josh Freeman led Tampa Bay on a hopeful go-ahead drive. Facing 4th down and 12 at the Atlanta 46-yard line, Freeman completed a 19-yard pass to Sammie Stroughter to keep the drive alive. On the next play, however, Freeman was intercepted by Brent Grimes at the 19-yard line, securing the victory for Atlanta.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Falcons win by?",
