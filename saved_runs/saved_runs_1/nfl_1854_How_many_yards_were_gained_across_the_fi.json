    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn week 13, the Lions hosted a rematch with division rivals the Chicago Bears. The Lions took an early lead when Drew Stanton ran in a 3-yard touchdown. The Bears tied it up near the end of the 1st quarter with a 1-yard run by Chester Taylor. The Lions broke the tie with a 50-yard field goal. The Bears responded with a 14-yard TD run by Matt Fort&#233;. The Lions took the lead just before halftime with a 46-yard TD catch by Calvin Johnson. The Lions only points of the 2nd half was a 25-yard field goal by Dave Rayner early in the 3rd quarter. The Bears responded with a 54-yard field goal by Robbie Gould. The Bears took the lead midway through the 4th quarter with a 7-yard TD catch by Brandon Manumaleuna and held off the Lions offense for the remainder of the game for the win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards were gained across the first two touchdowns when their values are added together?",
