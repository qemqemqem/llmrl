The Bills of Mortality began to be published regularly in 1603, in which year 33,347 deaths were recorded from plague. Between then and 1665, only four years had no recorded cases. In 1563, a thousand people were reportedly dying in London each week. In 1593, there were 15,003 deaths, 1625 saw 41,313 dead, between 1640 and 1646 came 11,000 deaths, culminating  in 3,597 for 1647. The 1625 outbreak was recorded at the time as the Great Plague, Until 1665, surpassed it. These official figures are likely to under-report actual numbers.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did it take for the 1625 death total to be surpassed?",
