The Texans' starting quarterback, Brian Hoyer, left the game with a concussion, but recently signed backup T. J. Yates threw a fourth-quarter touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins.  Andy Dalton drove the Bengals into Texans' territory, but A. J. Green fumbled, sealing the Texans' 10-6 victory over the Bengals. With the stunning loss, the Bengals drop to 8-1, and were no longer undefeated, leaving the New England Patriots as the only unbeaten team in the AFC at that point.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many points was the winning spread",
