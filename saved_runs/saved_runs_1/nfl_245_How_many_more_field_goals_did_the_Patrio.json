In the first quarter, Gostkowski kicked a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, New England continued to build on their lead, as Gostkowski kicked a 31-yard field goal, while Brady completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to Troy Brown.  The Dolphins responded with a two-yard touchdown run by running back Ronnie Brown and a 40-yard field goal by Olindo Mare as the first half came to a close.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Patriots secured their victory with the only points of the second half, a one-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Faulk. With the win, the Patriots advanced 4-1.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more field goals did the Patriots kick during the first half than the Dolphins?",
