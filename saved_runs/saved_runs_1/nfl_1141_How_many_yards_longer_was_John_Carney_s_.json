    "problem_text": "Context:\nWith their Super Bowl championship title to defend, the Giants began their season in the annual kickoff game against their NFC East rivals, the Washington Redskins.  In the first quarter, New York got a fast start as Super Bowl XLII MVP QB Eli Manning capped off the game's opening drive with a 1-yard TD run.  Later in the quarter, kicker John Carney managed to get  a 24-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the G-Men increased their lead with Carney nailing a 25-yard and a 47-yard field goal.  Near the end of the half, the Redskins managed to get on the board as QB Jason Campbell completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss. New York's defense stiffened in the second half and allowed them to hold on for the victory. With the win, not only did the Giants begin their season at 1-0, they also became the 9th-straight defending Super Bowl champion to win their season opener.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was John Carney's longest field goal than his shortest?",
