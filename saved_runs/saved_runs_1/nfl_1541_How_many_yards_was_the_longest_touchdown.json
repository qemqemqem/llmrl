Then, I listed the relevant information, which was that Drew Brees passed for 187 yards and three touchdowns, including a 4-yard touchdown catch, a 6-yard touchdown catch, and an 11-yard touchdown catch. By organizing the information in a table, I was able to quickly identify that the longest touchdown pass was 11 yards.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have also looked for additional information, such as the total number of touchdown passes in the game or the length of all the touchdown passes.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off a tough road win against the Rams, the Saints went to Raymond James Stadium for a Week 11 duel against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After a quick first quarter Tampa Bay touchdown from rookie quarterback Josh Freeman to Micheal Clayton to cap a 95-yard drive, the Bucs showed how the Saints struggled defensively. The Bucs looked to improve on their next drive by moving the ball with running backs Carnell Williams and Ernest Graham. The Saints would answer defensively as they took advantage of numerous mistakes by rookie Tampa Bay quarterback Josh Freeman. Drew Brees passed for 187 yards and three touchdowns. He connected with Robert Meacham for a 4-yard touchdown catch and a 6-yard touchdown catch, and to tight end David Thomas for an 11-yard touchdown. Pressure on the young Freeman from the Saints forced him to throw 3-interceptions and a fumble, allowing the Saints to take more control during the second half. The Saints would close out the game with two scores from running back Mike Bell from 3 yards and one yard out.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown pass?",
