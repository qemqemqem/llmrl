    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their impressive home win over the Ravens, the Bills flew to The Meadowlands for an AFC East rematch with the New York Jets.  In the first quarter, Buffalo busted out early with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 30-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, New York tied the game with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the period. During a scoreless third quarter, the Bills' starting QB (rookie Trent Edwards-14/21 for 130 yards and 1 interception) had to leave the game with a sprained right wrist, forcing a fully healed J. P. Losman into the game.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo took control with Lindell nailing a 40-yard field goal, along with Losman's 85-yard TD pass to WR Lee Evans. With the win, not only did Buffalo improve to 3-4, but they also swept the Jets for the first time since 1997.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Rian Lindell kick?",
