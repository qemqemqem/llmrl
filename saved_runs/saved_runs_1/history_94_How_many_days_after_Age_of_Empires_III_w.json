I found that the game was released on October 18, 2005, in North America and November 4, 2005, in Europe. To find the number of days between the two dates, I subtracted the North American release date from the European release date, which gave me 17 days. \n\nSince the problem was straightforward, there was not much room for improvement in terms of solving it.

The game portrays the European colonization of the Americas, between approximately 1492 and 1876 AD. There are fourteen total civilizations to play within the game.

Two expansion packs have been released: the first, Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs, was released on October 17, 2006, and introduced three Native American civilizations; the second, Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, was released on October 23, 2007, and included three Asian civilizations. Age of Empires III has sold over 2 million copies as of May 2008. As well as receiving favorable reviews, it has garnered awards, including GameSpy's \"Best RTS game of 2005\", and was one of the best-selling games of 2005. In 2007, Age of Empires III was the seventh best-selling computer game, with over 313,000 copies sold that year.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many days after Age of Empires III was released in North America, was it released in Europe?",
