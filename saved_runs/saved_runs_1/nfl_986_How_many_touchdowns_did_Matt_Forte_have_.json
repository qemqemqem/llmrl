    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their embarrassing divisional road loss to the Packers, the Bears flew to the Edward Jones Dome for a Week 12 duel with the St. Louis Rams.  In the first quarter, Chicago drew first blood as rookie RB Matt Fort&#233; got a 13-yard TD run, while QB Kyle Orton completed a 7-yard TD pass to FB Jason McKie.  In the second quarter, the Bears continued their domination as Fort&#233; got a 47-yard TD run.  The Rams would respond as kicker Josh Brown got a 43-yard field goal.  Chicago would close out the half with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 43-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, the Bears pulled away as Gould nailed a 38-yard field goal.  From there on out, Chicago's defense kept St. Louis in check.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Matt Forte have in the first half?",
