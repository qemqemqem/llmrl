    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn April 28, attorneys met with Santoro and said they made substantial progress on a revised plan. They reported having settled all disputes with Vicks creditors, including Joel. On August 27, Santoro approved the revised reorganization plan. It was supported by all of Vicks creditors but one who was owed $13,000. Every creditor was to be paid back in six years on the condition that an estimated $9 million in assets be liquidated. Vick was allowed annual living expenses of $300,000 under the plan. He could spend up to $3,500 a month for rent in Philadelphia and $750 for \"utilities and miscellaneous.\" He was to pay $3,712 a month on the mortgage for his house in Hampton, Virginia, where his fianc\u00e9e and two children lived, and could pay up to $1,355 per month in private school tuition for his children. Vick was also given up to $472 a month in car-related expenses. His mother was allowed $2,500 per month, and his former girlfriend Tameka Taylor was allotted $3,000 per month to support their son, Mitez. Vick was not required to pay creditors during his first season with the Eagles. Vick paid his agent, Joel Segal (sports agent), $32,500 in 2010, $104,000 in 2011, and would pay him $160,000 each year from 2012-2015 for a total of $776,500. He paid bankruptcy lawyers $748,750 in 2010, $1 million in 2011, and a total of $2.6 million.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many dollars did Vick pay his agent between 2010 and 2012?",
