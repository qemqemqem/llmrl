In the first quarter the Jets took the lead as kicker Nick Folk nailed a 37-yard field goal. The Texans replied in the second quarter with RB Arian Foster getting a 2-yard TD run. The Jets got the lead back as QB Mark Sanchez threw a 4-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes; followed by Folk making a 30-yard field goal. The Jets' lead extended in the third quarter when Sanchez found Holmes again on a 41-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter Folk made a 30-yard field goal to put the Jets up 23-7. The Texans rallied to take the lead back with kicker Neil Rackers nailing a 38-yard field goal, followed by QB Matt Schaub completing a 43-yard TD pass to TE Joel Dreessen, followed by Foster getting a 1-yard TD run, and then Rackers got a 22-yard field goal. The Jets still managed to score to get the win with Sanchez finding Holmes again on a 6-yard TD pass.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many passing tds were there in this game?",
