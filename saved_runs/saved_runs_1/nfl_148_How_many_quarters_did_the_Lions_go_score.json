After a scoreless first quarter, the Lions trailed early as QB Matt Leinart hooked up with WR Bryant Johnson on a 2-yard TD pass, while kicker Neil Rackers kicked a 36-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, things got more complicated for Detroit as Leinart ran the ball in on a 9-yard TD run.  The Lions would finally get on the board with kicker Jason Hanson nailing a 32-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, even though Detroit would get a 2-yard TD run by RB Arlen Harris, Arizona's defense held the Lions long enough for the win.  With the loss, Detroit would fall to 2-8.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many quarters did the Lions go scoreless?",
