Again, the Falcons get off to a great start scoring 20 unanswered points for the 2nd straight week. The fast scoring started with Matt Ryan's 8-yard touchdown pass to Jacquizz Rodgers (with a failed 2-point conversion) for a 6-0 lead in the first quarter, followed up in the second quarter with a 7-yard pass to Tony Gonzalez for a 13-0 lead and finally a 9-yard pass to Julio Jones for a 20-0 halftime lead. The Chargers got their only points of the game as Nate Kaeding scored a field goal from 41 yards out, but the Falcons scored the final points in the fourth quarter on a Michael Turner 7-yard touchdown run to make the final score 27-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did Falcons win by?",
