    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a three-game losing streak, the Rams flew to Candlestick Park for a Week 11 NFC West duel with their rival, the San Francisco 49ers. In the first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as 49ers RB Frank Gore got a 5-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Rams responded with kicker Josh Brown getting a 24-yard field goal. However, San Francisco took a commanding lead as QB Shaun Hill completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis, Gore got a 1-yard TD run, Hill got a 1-yard TD run, and Hill completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Bryant Johnson. In the third quarter, St. Louis hacked at their deficit as Brown nailed a 48-yard and a 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Rams tried to complete their comeback as QB Marc Bulger completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Dane Looker. However, the 49ers' defense was too much to overcome.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
