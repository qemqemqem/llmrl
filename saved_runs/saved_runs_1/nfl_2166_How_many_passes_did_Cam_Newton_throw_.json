    "problem_text": "Context:\nAgainst former defensive coordinator Ron Rivera and tight end Greg Olsen, the Bears scored touchdowns on all three phases (offense, defense, special teams). Matt Forte, who was only able to record two yards the week before, recorded 205 yards against Carolina, as well as a 17-yard touchdown run. Though the Bears defense was able to keep Carolina from converting only 2 of 12 third down attempts, and D. J. Moore was able to pick off Cam Newton, the defense did not record a sack, and allowed 547 yards. Devin Hester also returned a punt 69 yards for a touchdown, which broke the all-time punt return touchdown record. Hester would also return a kickoff 73 yards. However, Newton completed 27 of 46 passes for 374 yards, 1 touchdown and an 83.1 passer rating while also rushing for 35 yards and two TDs on eight carries, and the score was 34-29 late in the game when Newton connected with Olsen with&#160;:04 left in the game. The Panthers attempted to kick an onside kick, but Hester would recover the kick and give Chicago the victory.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many passes did Cam Newton throw?",
