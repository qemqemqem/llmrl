    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Bears, the Eagles went home for a Week 13 interconference duel with the Houston Texans on Thursday night.  Philadelphia delivered the opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback Michael Vick found running back LeSean McCoy on a 1-yard touchdown pass.  The Texans replied with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 48-yard field goal, yet the Eagles answered in the second quarter with a 4-yard touchdown run from McCoy, followed by a 36-yard field goal from kicker David Akers.  Houston struck back with quarterback Matt Schaub completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jacoby Jones.  Philadelphia would close out the half with a 22-yard field goal from Akers. The Texans took the third quarter with running back Arian Foster catching a 13-yard touchdown pass from Schaub and running for a 3-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles regained the lead with Vick's 2-yard touchdown run and his 5-yard touchdown pass to fullback Owen Schmitt.  Afterwards, Philadelphia's defense prevented any comeback attempt from Houston.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Akers longest field goal compared to his shortest?",
