    "problem_text": "Context:\nThere were two main movements for the west side. The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople  on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria. The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many months did the April Uprising last?",
