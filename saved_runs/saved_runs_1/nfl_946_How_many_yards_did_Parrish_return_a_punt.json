    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Bills began their 2008 campaign at home against the Seattle Seahawks.  In the first quarter, Buffalo drew first blood as running back Marshawn Lynch got a 21-yard touchdown run.  In the second quarter, the Bills increased their lead with wide receiver/punt returner Roscoe Parrish returning a punt 63 yards for a touchdown.  The Seahawks responded with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completing a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Nate Burleson.  Buffalo closed out the half with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 35-yard and a 38-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Seattle responded with kicker Olindo Mare nailing a 45-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Buffalo dug into their bag of tricks. Appearing to attempt a 32-yard field goal, holder Brian Moorman completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to defensive end Ryan Denney.  The Bills pulled away with quarterback Trent Edwards completing a 30-yard touchdown pass to tight end Robert Royal. With this win, the Bills started their season with a 1-0 record.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did Parrish return a punt?",
