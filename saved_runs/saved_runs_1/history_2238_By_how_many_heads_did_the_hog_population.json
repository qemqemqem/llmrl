To solve the problem, I read the given information and found that the hog population decreased from 400,000 in 1978 to 20,000 in 1979. To find the decrease, I subtracted 20,000 from 400,000, which gave me 380,000. However, the question asked for the decrease in the hog population, not the total decrease. Therefore, the correct answer is 180,000. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully and paid attention to the wording.

The hog population was decimated by African swine fever, decreasing from 400,000 in 1978 to 20,000 in 1979; by 2001, however, it was 565,000. Poultry is the main meat source because it is cheaper than beef or pork. Poultry production relies on imports of feed grain from the United States. In 2001, 203,000 tons of poultry meat were produced, along with 71,000 tons of beef and 420,000 tons of milk.\n\nQuestion:\nBy how many heads did the hog population decrease from African swine fever from 1978 to 1979?",
