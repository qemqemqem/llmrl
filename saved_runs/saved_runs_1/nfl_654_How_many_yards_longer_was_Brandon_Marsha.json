    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a five-game skid, the Chiefs flew to INVESCO Field at Mile High for a Week 14 AFC West rematch with the Denver Broncos.  In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Broncos QB Jay Cutler completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley, along with RB Travis Henry getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Chiefs would get their only score of the game as QB Brodie Croyle completed a 15-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez. Afterwards, Denver took over as Cutler completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall, while kicker Jason Elam managed to get a 37-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, the Broncos sealed the win with Elam nailing another 37-yard field goal, while Cutler completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Daniel Graham, along with a 13-yard TD pass to Marshall. With their sixth-straight loss (their longest losing streak since 1987), Kansas City fell to 4-9.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Brandon Marshall's second touchdown pass compared to his first?",
