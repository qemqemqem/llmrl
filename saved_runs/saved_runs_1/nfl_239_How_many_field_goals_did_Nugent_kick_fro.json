    "problem_text": "Context:\nFollowing their win over the Lions, the Vikings went home for a Week 15 interconference fight with the New York Jets. In the first quarter, the Vikes took an early lead with QB Brad Johnson completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Travis Taylor. However, the Jets struck back with RB Cedric Houston with a 6-yard TD run. In the second quarter, things got bad for Minnesota. First, New York got a 25-yard field goal from kicker Mike Nugent. Then, QB Chad Pennington completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles. Afterwards, Nugent would kick a 52-yard and a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Jets' lead increased with Nugent's 20-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, rookie QB Tarvaris Jackson came in a completed a 35-yard TD pass to RB Mewelde Moore. That would be the only response from the Purple People Eaters. With the loss, the Vikings fell to 6-8.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Nugent kick from longer than 40 yards?",
