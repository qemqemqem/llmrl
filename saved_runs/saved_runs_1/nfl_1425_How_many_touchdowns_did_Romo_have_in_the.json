In the first quarter, Dallas began their dominating day with kicker Nick Folk booting a 36-yard field goal.  The Cowboys would add onto their lead in the second quarter as running back Felix Jones got a 46-yard touchdown, followed by quarterback Tony Romo finding wide receiver Miles Austin on a 9-yard touchdown pass. The Raiders would try to rally in the third quarter as quarterback Bruce Gradkowski completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, yet Dallas would pull away in the fourth quarter as Romo hooked up with wide receiver Roy Williams. Romo (18/29, 309 yards, 2 TDs), Austin (7 receptions, 145 yards, 1 TD), & tight end Jason Witten (5 receptions, 107 yards) were named CBS's All-Iron Award winners.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Romo have in the game?",
