The Patriots' Kevin Faulk converted the Texans' mistake into an 11-yard TD run. Faulk also scored on a 43-yard screen pass, and Tom Brady threw another touchdown pass, covering 6 yards to former Texan Jabar Gaffney. The Patriots' defense had four sacks and three interceptions and held the Texans to 76 yards in the first two quarters. The Texans trailed 27-0 at halftime. Ron Dayne scored on a 1-yard run on the Texans' first series of the third quarter, but Ellis Hobbs returned the ensuing kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown to put the game out of reach. David Carr turned in another poor performance completing 16-of-28 for 127 yards and four interceptions.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards shorter was Tom Brady's second touchdown pass compared to his first?",
