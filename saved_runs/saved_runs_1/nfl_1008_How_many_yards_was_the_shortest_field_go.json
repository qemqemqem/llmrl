In the first quarter, the 'Boys shot first as QB Tony Romo completed a 21-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.  In the second quarter, the Redskins took the lead as QB Jason Campbell completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR James Thrash and a 2-yard TD pass to WR Antwaan Randle El, along with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 20-yard field goal.  Dallas closed out the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 36-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Cowboys tied the game with Romo completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Washington would respond with Suisham kicking a 33-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Redskins increased their lead with Suisham nailing a 33-yard and a 29-yard field goal.  The 'Boys tried to rally as Romo completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Miles Austin.  However, Dallas' onside kick attempt failed, preserving the Redskins' win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest field goal?",
