    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Chargers, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West rematch against the Oakland Raiders. In the first half, the Broncos' defense held the Raiders' offense to -12 net yards of offense, and the Broncos' offense dominated the time of possession by a nearly 3-1 margin, but had to settle for four field goals by placekicker Brandon McManus &#8212; from 41 and 35 yards in the first quarter, and 29 and 20 yards in the second quarter. The latter field goal occurred after wide receiver Demaryius Thomas dropped a crucial pass in the end zone from quarterback Brock Osweiler with only four seconds before halftime. The Raiders got on the scoreboard on the initial possession of the second half, with quarterback Derek Carr connecting with wide receiver Seth Roberts on an 11-yard touchdown pass. Later in the third quarter, the Broncos were backed up to their own 2-yard line following a Raiders' punt, and three plays later, the Raiders pulled to within 12-9, when defensive end Khalil Mack forced a fumble off Osweiler in the end zone for a safety. The Broncos' forced another Raiders' punt, however, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, Emmanuel Sanders muffed a punt deep in Broncos' territory, and the Raiders capitalized three plays later, with Carr throwing a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mychal Rivera (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). The Broncos drove down the field on their next offensive possession, but McManus missed on a 49-yard field goal attempt that hit the left upright. After each team traded punts, the Raiders were attempting to add to their lead, but placekicker Sebastian Janikowski missed wide left on a 43-yard field goal attempt with 5:27 remaining in the game. The Broncos were facing a 4th-and-5 at their own 38-yard line with 3:50 remaining in the game, but tight end Vernon Davis dropped a pass from Osweiler that would have been a first down. The Broncos' defense forced the Raiders to go three-and-out, while being forced to use two of their remaining three team timeouts. With 2:35 remaining, the Broncos had one last possession, but on the sixth play, another dropped 4th-down pass &#8212; this one by Thomas &#8212; sealed the Raiders' win. The Broncos wore their alternate navy blue jerseys for this game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes of at least 10 yards did Carr throw?",
