    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Seahawks' fourth game was played at Edward Jones Dome where they played an NFC west rivalry match against the Rams. In the first quarter the Seahawks trailed early as QB Sam Bradford completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Gibson. The Seahawks cut the lead with kicker Olindo Mare nailing a 22-yard field goal, but the Rams increased their lead when kicker Josh Brown made a 30-yard field goal, followed in the 3rd quarter by Bradford completing a 21-yard TD pass to RB Kenneth Darby. Then Josh Brown made a 31-yard field goal to put the Seahawks further behind. With the loss, Seattle fell to 2-2 coming into their bye week and their 10-game winning streak against the Rams was snapped.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Josh Brown's second field goal than his first?",
