Teams from these three seasons spent all but two of the 53 poll weeks in the top 10, and 38 of them in the top 5. They captured two Big Ten crowns in 1990\u201391 and 1992\u201393 Indiana Hoosiers mens basketball team, and during the 1991\u201392 Indiana Hoosiers mens basketball team season reached the 1992 NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Tournament. During the 1992\u201393 Indiana Hoosiers mens basketball team season, the 31\u20134 Hoosiers finished the season at the top of the AP Poll, but were defeated by Kansas Jayhawks mens basketball in the 1993 NCAA Mens Division I Basketball Tournament. Teams from this era included Greg Graham, Pat Knight, All-Americans Damon Bailey and Alan Henderson, and National Player of the Year Calbert Cheaney.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many All-Americans were on the Indiana teams from this 1990-93 era?",
