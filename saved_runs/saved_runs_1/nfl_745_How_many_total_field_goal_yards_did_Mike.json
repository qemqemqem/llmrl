    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their season-sweep over the Dolphins, the Jets went home for a Week 14 intraconference duel with the Cleveland Browns.  After a scoreless first quarter, New York trailed in the second quarter as Browns QB Derek Anderson completed a 7-yard TD pass to RB Jamal Lewis.  The Jets would get on the board with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cleveland responded with Anderson completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  The Jets would reply with Nugent kicking a 41-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Browns increased their lead with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 49-yard field goal.  New York would creep closer with QB Kellen Clemens getting a 1-yard TD run (with a failed 2-point conversion), while Nugent kicked a 38-yard field goal.  However, Cleveland sealed the win with Lewis getting a 31-yard touchdown.  The Jets would end the game with Nugent nailing a 35-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total field goal yards did Mike Nugent kick?",
