    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe game started out slow for both the Texans and Chiefs, but with Kansas City poised to score first, rookie placekicker Justin Medlock missed a 30-yard field goal. The Texans used their second possession to advance to the red zone, but a pass from Matt Schaub intended for Andre Johnson was intercepted by Chiefs safety Jarrad Page in the end zone. Beginning the second quarter, Chiefs center Casey Wiegmann fumbled the ball, but it was recovered by quarterback Damon Huard. After a possession by the Texans, kick returner Eddie Drummond fumbled and the ball was recovered by Houston. The Texans capitalized on the turnover and scored first through a field goal. With just over six minutes left in the half, Matt Schaub completed a 77-yard pass to Andre Johnson, and the Texans secured their lead, 10-0. Beginning the third quarter, Chiefs fullback Kris Wilson appeared to have fumbled the football, although it was disputed whether or not he had possession. The fumble was recovered by Texans defensive end Mario Williams for a touchdown. The Chiefs finally scored, through a field goal, with thirty seconds remaining in the third quarter. For the first ten minutes of play in the fourth quarter, the Texans controlled the ball and kept the Chiefs' offense off the field. When the Chiefs received their first chance to score in the fourth quarter with just over five minutes remaining, they failed to capitalize on offense. For only the second time in Texans history, the franchise won their opening day game as the Chiefs began their season at 0-1. The Chiefs' Eddie Kennison pulled his hamstring on the team's first possession, and Patrick Surtain injured his shoulder. RB Larry Johnson was limited by the Texans defense to just 43&#160;yards on 10 carries.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points for the former were there after the 77 yard touchdown?",
