    "problem_text": "Context:\nRub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez established most of the early long-standing record in the BSN. He broke both the single-season points record with 810 in 1978 and the most career points record with 11,549. The current holder of the career mark is Georgie Torres, who broke it before retiring in 2001 with 15,863 points in  679 games, playing his entire career after the establishment of the three-point line. Rodr\u00edguez also holds the mark for most rebounds in a career with 6,178. He also held the single-season rebound record with 380 in 1978, which stood until Lee Benson broke it in 2008. Currently, Neftal\u00ed Rivera holds the record for most points in a game in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional when he scored 79 points on May 22, 1974. In that game he achieve the record by making 34 field goals(all of them 2-pointers as the 3-pointers where not adopted back then) and 11 free throws. In 1989, Pablo Alicea of the Gigantes de Carolina established a record for most assists in one game with 25. The record stood for over two decades until May 1, 2012, when Jonathan Garc\u00eda of the Caciques de Humacao broke it recording 33 assists against the Brujos de Guayama. Garc\u00edas mark is an unofficial world record pending the approval of Guinness World Records, since there is no higher number recorded in any amateur or professional international league or in FIBA competition. During this game, the Caciques also established the team points record for a single game with 130 and for most scored during a single (10-minute) quarter with 46. The Vaqueros de Bayam\u00f3n hosted the game with most assistance in the league, with 17,621 fans attending a home game against R\u00edo Piedras on September 8, 1969. This bested the previous top of 16,564 in a game between Ponce and Santurce. The Vaqueros also hold the record for most consecutive championships, winning five from 1971-75.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after Rub\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez set the record of most career points was his record broken by Georgie Torres?",
