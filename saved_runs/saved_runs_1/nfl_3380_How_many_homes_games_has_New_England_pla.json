Tom Brady's attempted comeback in the fourth quarter was not enough to beat Cam Newton and the Panthers as Carolina upset New England 33-30. At the end of Week 4, the Patriots' defense was ranked last in the entire NFL. This was the second consecutive time that the Pats lost a heartbreaker to Cam Newton. With the loss, the Pats fell to 2-2. Brady's record against the Panthers overall also fell to 2-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many homes games has New England played so far this season?",
