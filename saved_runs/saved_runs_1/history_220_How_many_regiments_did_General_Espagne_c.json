This is also confirmed in an extract of Moreau's dispatch to the French Minister of War, published in the London Chronicle, 10 June 1800.  \"The 6th Chasseurs, 13th Cavalry, 4th Hussars and 11th Chasseurs distinguished themselves in this affair.  The rest of the division, and that of , passed rapidly  the Danube...General Grenier was equally well prepared.\" In addition, the presence  of Th\u00e9ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, the First Grenadier of France, suggests that the grenadier company of the 46th Demi-brigade infantry de ligne was at least engaged.  In addition, General Espagne's 37th and 84th Regiments were engaged, as were grenadiers the 109th Regiment.  Lecourbe mentions the 37th and the 109th several times in his own account of the battle, so apparently they were heavily engaged: this would include the brigades of Fran\u00e7ois Goullus and Fran\u00e7ois Bontemps.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many regiments did General Espagne control?",
