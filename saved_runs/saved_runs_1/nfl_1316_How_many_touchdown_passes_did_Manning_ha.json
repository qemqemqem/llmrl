Arizona took flight in the first quarter with kicker Neil Rackers' 38-yard field goal.  However, the Colts took a monster lead in the second quarter as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne, a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark, and a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on. The Cardinals tried to fight back in the third quarter as quarterback Kurt Warner hooked up with wide receiver Anquan Boldin on a 10-yard touchdown pass, but Indianapolis replied with Manning's 3-yard touchdown pass to running back Joseph Addai.  Afterwards, the Colts closed out the game in the fourth quarter with kicker Adam Vinatieri's 26-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes did Manning have in the 2nd quarter?",
