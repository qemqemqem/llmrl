To solve the problem, I would need to find the difference between the total yards of touchdown passes thrown by Eli Manning and Matt Ryan. From the given information, Eli Manning threw touchdown passes of 4 and 28 yards, totaling 32 yards, while Matt Ryan threw touchdown passes of 4 and 11 yards, totaling 15 yards. Therefore, the difference between the total yards of touchdown passes thrown by Eli Manning and Matt Ryan is 32 - 15 = 17 yards. \n\nTo avoid making a mistake in the future, I will double-check my calculations and ensure that I have accurately interpreted the given information.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from a loss against the rival Panthers, the Falcons flew to Giants Stadium for a Week 11 duel with the New York Giants. In the first quarter, the Falcons trailed early with kicker Lawrence Tynes making a 39-yard field goal. In the second quarter the Falcons came on top with fullback Jason Snelling getting a 7-yard touchdown run, until they fell behind with quarterback Eli Manning hooking up with tight end Kevin Boss on a 4 and a 28-yard touchdown pass. In the third quarter, fullback Jason Snelling got a 1-yard touchdown run for the Falcons. The Giants made it a 2-possession game with running back Brandon Jacobs getting a 2-yard touchdown run, until the Falcons replied with kicker Jason Elam making a 25-yard field goal. The Giants tried to pull away in the fourth quarter with Manning passing to fullback Madison Hedgecock 3 yards for a touchdown, until the Falcons stepped up to tie the game with quarterback Matt Ryan completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Weems, then found tight end Tony Gonzalez on an 11-yard touchdown pass. At overtime, the Falcons lost the game with kicker Lawrence Tynes getting the game-winning field goal from 36 yards away.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more yards of touchdown passes did Eli Manning throw than Matt Ryan?",
