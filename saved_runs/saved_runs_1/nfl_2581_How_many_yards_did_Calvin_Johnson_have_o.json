Therefore, the total yards gained by Calvin Johnson on his two touchdown receptions would be 72 + the distance of the second touchdown reception.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, the Cardinals struck first on a Jay Feely 47-yard field goal. The Lions responded with a 72-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson, to take a 7-3 lead. The Cardinals went up 10-7 on a 36-yard TD pass from Carson Palmer to Andre Ellington.  The Lions retook the lead, 14-10, when Stafford and Johnson connected again, this time on a 3-yard TD pass. Arizona scored first in the third quarter, capitalizing on a Lions turnover with a 23-yard Jay Feely field goal. The Lions got a turnover of their own, as DeAndre Levy returned an interception 66 yards for a touchdown, making the score 21-13. The Cardinals finished the third quarter scoring with a 43-yard Feely field goal to close the score to 21-16. Feely hit again from 33 yards early in the fourth quarter to make the score 21-19. A pass interference penalty by Bill Bentley put the ball on the Lions 1-yard line late in the final quarter, and Arizona's Rashard Mendenhall plunged over two plays later for a touchdown. Arizona failed on a 2-point conversion, making the final score Cardinals 25, Lions 21. Matthew Stafford was 24-of-36 passing for 278 yards and two touchdowns. Calvin Johnson led all receivers with 6 receptions for 116 yards and two touchdowns.  David Akers missed a 47-yard field goal, and had another field goal attempt blocked.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did Calvin Johnson have on his two touchdown receptions?",
