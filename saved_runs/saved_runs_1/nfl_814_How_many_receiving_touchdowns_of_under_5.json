QB Alex Smith (who was recovering from a separate right shoulder since Week 4) was healthy enough to get the start. In the first quarter, San Francisco trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Marques Colston, while kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 26-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Niners' struggles continued as Brees completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Terrance Copper, along with completing a 3-yard TD pass to Colston. In the third quarter, San Francisco managed to get on the board with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 29-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans wrapped up the win with Brees and Colston hooking up with each other again on a 15-yard TD pass. The Niners' only response was Smith completing a 7-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many receiving touchdowns of under 5-yards did Marques Colston catch?",
