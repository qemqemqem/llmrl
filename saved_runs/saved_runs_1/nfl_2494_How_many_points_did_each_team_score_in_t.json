The Rams drew first blood in the first quarter with a 48-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein to take a 3-0 lead for the only score of that quarter. The Lions then took a 7-3 lead with Joique Bell's 1-yard run for a touchdown in the 2nd quarter. The Rams responded with a 29-yard field goal from Zuerlein as they came up within a point 7-6 before on the Lions' next possession, Matthew Stafford was picked off by Cortland Finnegan and it was returned 31 yards for a touchdown as the Rams retook the lead 13-7. The Lions then responded with Jason Hanson kicking a 41-yard field goal to shorten the Rams' lead to 13-10 at halftime. After the break, the Lions scored first with Jason Hanson kicking a 45-yard field goal to tie the game 13-13 for the only score of the 3rd quarter. However, the Rams moved back into the lead in the 4th quarter with Brandon Gibson's 23-yard catch from Sam Bradford to make it 20-13. The Lions tied the game back up with Kevin Smith running for a touchdown from 5 yards out to tie the game 20-20. The Rams then retook the lead with Greg Zuerlein kicking a 46-yard field goal to make the score 23-20. On their last possession, the Lions moved down the field and Matthew Stafford found Kevin Smith on a 5-yard touchdown pass to make the final score 27-23 as the Rams began their season 0-1.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did each team score in the second quarter?",
