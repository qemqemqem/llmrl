In the fourth quarter with the Texans trailing 42-0, Mallett was pulled in favor of Brian Hoyer. Hoyer immediately performed better, passing for 2 touchdowns. However, to add insult to injury on what was already a bad day, with 1 second left to play on 4th and goal, Houston fumbled the ball with Nathan Stupar recovering it for an 84-yard touchdown. Taking the knee on a two-point conversion, the Falcons finished with a 48-21 victory.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points, 48-21, did the Falcons win over the Texans?",
