Just like in the Chiefs game, the Panthers went into the fourth quarter holding New Orleans to only three points. They had a 23-3 lead but the Saints managed to rally and get within three with 5:11 left in the game. Late in the fourth quarter star linebacker Luke Kuechly left the game and was evaluated for a concussion. The Panthers were able to hold off New Orleans and win 23-20, improving to 4-6.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points was Carolina's largest lead?",
