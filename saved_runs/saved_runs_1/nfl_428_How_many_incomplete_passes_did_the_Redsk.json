    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn his first game at home as the starter for the Redskins, Jason Campbell, again, had an encouraging game completing 11 of 23 passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns. A rather dull first half for both teams saw the scoreboard read 6-3 in favor of Carolina.  In the second half Jason Campbell threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle El and the Redskins took the lead at 10-6.  In the fourth quarter Steve Smith scored on an 8-yard pass from Jake Delhomme to give Carolina a 13-10 lead.  Later in the fourth quarter Jason Campbell threw to Chris Cooley for a 66-yard touchdown giving the Redskins the lead for good.  Carolina threatened near the end of the game, but a Jake Delhomme pass was intercepted in the endzone by Redskins Safety Sean Taylor.  With the 17-13 victory, the Redskins record stood at 4-7. Stats\n\nQuestion:\nHow many incomplete passes did the Redskins have?",
