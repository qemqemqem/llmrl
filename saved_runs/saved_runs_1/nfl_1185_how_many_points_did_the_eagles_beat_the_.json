Rookie DeSean Jackson pulled down a 47-yard reception on the second play, and the drive finished with a shovel pass touchdown to Brian Westbrook.  Donovan McNabb marched the Eagles down the field again on their second possession, finding L.J. Smith in the back of the end zone to make it 14-0.  Late in the second quarter, receiver Hank Baskett beat the coverage and scored on a 90-yard reception (which was also McNabb's second longest career TD pass).  Fullback Tony Hunt scored from a yard out in the third quarter.  DeSean Jackson's 60-yard punt return set up a short field goal for David Akers, and Philadelphia's lead grew to 31-0.  Westbrook added a 6-yard rushing touchdown early in the fourth quarter before St. Louis kicked a field goal to avoid the shutout.  McNabb threw for 361 yards and three scores.  Jackson, Greg Lewis, and Baskett each had over 100 yards receiving.  Westbrook ran for 91 yards and two touchdowns\n\nQuestion:\nhow many points did the eagles beat the rams with?",
