    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Buccaneers opened the regular season at home against the Baltimore Ravens on September 10 with a shutout, their first since Week 14 of the 2005 season. The game began with the Ravens scoring a touchdown after a clock-killing 80-yard drive, and the Bucs were never able to respond. Bucs QB Chris Simms threw three interceptions and many of his passes were batted down at the line of scrimmage, an issue that was present during the pre-season and would continue to plague Simms in the next two games. In addition, second-year RB Carnell Williams struggled with back spasms and was held to just 22 rushing yards on 8 carries.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many interceptions did Simms throw?",
