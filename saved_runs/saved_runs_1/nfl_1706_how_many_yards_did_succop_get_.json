The Cardinals scored with kicker Jay Feely hitting a 36-yard field goal, but they fell behind with QB Matt Cassel completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe. This was followed by RB Thomas Jones getting a 1 and a 3-yard TD run. The Cardinals responded with Feely making a 29-yard field goal, but they struggled further with kicker Ryan Succop getting a 23-yard field goal, followed by Cassel throwing a 38-yard TD pass to Bowe. The Cardinals cut the lead with QB Derek Anderson completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did succop get?",
