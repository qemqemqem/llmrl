Prices increased rapidly from 2001, but the 1980 high was not exceeded until January 3, 2008, when a new maximum of $865.35 per troy weight was set. Another record price was set on March 17, 2008, at $1023.50 per troy ounce ($32.91/g).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after 1980 was there a new maximum price of gold?",
