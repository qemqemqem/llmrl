    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill on the hunt for their first win of the season, the Rams flew to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium for a Week 6 interconference duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  St. Louis got the opening charge in the first quarter with quarterback Marc Bulger's 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donnie Avery.  The Jaguars would answer with running back Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 4-yard touchdown run (with a failed PAT).  Afterwards, the Rams would get the only points of the second quarter as kicker Josh Brown nailed a 52-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, a back-and-forth quarter would ensue. Jones-Drew would help Jacksonville take the lead with a 1-yard touchdown run, yet Rams defensive end Leonard Little would return an interception 36 yards for a touchdown. Following a 3-yard touchdown run by Jones-Drew, St. Louis would tie the game with Brown's 27-yard field goal.  However, in overtime, the Jaguars got the last laugh as kicker Josh Scobee booted the game-winning 36-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was the longest touchdown run than the shortest in the game?",
