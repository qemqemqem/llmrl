To solve the problem, I should have paid closer attention to the information provided in the passage. The passage states that most of the Prussian estates, aside from the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, pledged allegiance to their new ruler after 15 April. However, the question asks for the number of days after Johannes von Baysen was named the first governor of Prussia. To find the answer, I should have subtracted the date on which Johannes von Baysen was named governor (9 March) from the date on which most of the Prussian estates pledged allegiance (15 April), which would give the correct answer of 37 days.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn January 1454, the year that Casimir IV was married to Elisabeth Habsburg, the Prussian faction asked Casimir IV and protection by the Kingdom of Poland. Casimir asked the Prussian Confederation for a more formal petition. On 4 February 1454, the Secret Council of the Prussian Confederation sent a formal act of disobedience to the Grand Master. Two days later the confederacy started its rebellion and soon almost all Prussia, except for Marienburg, Stuhm , and Konitz , were free from Teutonic rule. Most of the captured Ordensburg castles were immediately destroyed. On 10 February 1454, the confederacy sent an official delegation to Poland, headed by Johannes von Baysen. By 20 February, the delegates were in Krak\u00f3w and asked Casimir to bring Prussia into the Polish kingdom. After negotiating the exact conditions of incorporation, the king agreed and delegates of the Prussian Confederation pledged allegiance to Casimir on 6 March 1454. On the same day, the king agreed to all the conditions of the Prussian delegates \u2014 for instance Thorn demanded the destruction of the Polish city of Nieszawa \u2014 giving wide privileges to the Prussian cities and nobility. Three days later, Johannes von Baysen was named as the first governor of Prussia. After 15 April, most of the Prussian estates, with the exception of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, pledged allegiance to their new ruler. Poland sent the Grand Master a declaration of war, predated to 22 February. Both sides expected the war to end quickly.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many days after JOhannes von Baysen was named the first governor of Prussia had most of the Prussian estates, aside from the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, pleged allegiance to their new ruler?",
