I misunderstood the question and calculated the percentage difference between the two ratios instead of the percentage lower. To find the percentage lower, we can simply subtract Manchester United's ratio from Arsenal's ratio and divide the result by Arsenal's ratio, then multiply by 100%. Using this method, we get:\n\nPercentage lower = ((50% - 46%) / 50%) x 100%\nPercentage lower = 4%\n\nTherefore, Manchester United's wage bill to turnover ratio is 4% lower than Arsenal's.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully and double-checked my calculations to avoid errors.",

The club has the highest number of shirt sales a season, around 1.5 million. For the 2010\u201311 season its wage bill totalled \u20ac169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona. However, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the worlds most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion. It was valued at \u20ac3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016\u201317 season it was the Deloitte Football Money League football club in the world, with an annual revenue of \u20ac674.6 million.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percent lower was Manchester United's wage bill to turnover ratio compared to Arsenal's?",
