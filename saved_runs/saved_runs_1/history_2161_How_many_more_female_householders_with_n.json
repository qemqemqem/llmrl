    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I calculated the difference between the percentage of female householders with no husbands present and the percentage of male householders with no wives present, which is 6.3% - 3.2% = 3.1%. This means that there were 3.1% more female householders with no husbands present than male householders with no wives present. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have used actual numbers instead of percentages to calculate the difference. For example, if there were 100 households, 6.3% of them would have a female householder with no husband present, which is 6.3 households. Similarly, 3.2% of them would have a male householder with no wife present, which is 3.2 households. Then, the difference between the two would be 6.3 - 3.2 = 3.1 households, which is the same as the percentage difference.",
