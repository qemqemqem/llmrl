    "problem_text": "Context:\nWith a Chiefs loss earlier in the day, the Raiders welcomed the struggling New York Giants to Oakland with Eli Manning being benched in favor of Geno Smith. A win would mean that the Raiders, who already controlled their own destiny, would be tied for first place in the AFC West with the Chiefs. After holding the Giants to three plays and out on their first drive, Marshawn Lynch rushed for 60 yards on three attempts including a 51-yard rush for a touchdown to put the Raiders up early 7-0.  both offenses sputtered for the remainder of the first quarter, before the Giants tied the game on a one-yard run by Orleans Darkwa near the end of the quarter. The Raiders would retake the lead in the second quarter on a Giorgio Tavecchio 39-yard field goal. The Raider defense played well in the first half, limiting the Giants to only 16 yards rushing in the half. In the third quarter, both offenses continued to struggle, but the Raiders began to over the ball with just over four minutes left in the quarter. However, a Johnny Holton fumble ended the drive. However, the Raiders were able to capitalize in the fourth when DeAndr&#233; Washington scored from nine yards out to give the Raiders a 17-7 lead with 10 minutes to play. The Giants immediately answered as Geno Smith hit Evan Engram for a 10-yard touchdown pass to pull within three again with under six minutes remaining. The Raiders quickly answered as Derek Carr hit Cordarrelle Patterson on a 49-yard catch and run to give the Raiders the ball at the Giants nine yard line. Two plays later, Carr hit Holdon, who again fumbled as he crossed the goal line. However, the play was ruled a touchdown and the Raiders moved their lead to 24-14 with three minutes left in the game. The Raider defense allowed the Giants to move into Oakland territory, but forced a 52-yard field goal. On the ensuing onside kick, the Raiders recovered and were able to run out the clock. Derek Carr threw for 287 yards in the 24-17 victory as the Raider defense limited the Giants to 265 net yards. Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin each forced Geno Smith to fumble in the game to stop potential Giant scoring drives.The win moved the Raiders to 6-6 on the season and into a first-place tie with the Chiefs and Chargers who had also won.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were scored in the first half?",
