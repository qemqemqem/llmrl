In the first quarter the Cowboys took the lead as kicker David Buehler hit a 34-yard field goal. But they fell behind with QB David Garrard getting a 10-yard TD pass to WR Mike Sims-Walker. In the second quarter, the Cowboys struggled further with Garrard finding TE Marcedes Lewis on a 42-yard TD pass, then in the third quarter he found WR Mike Thomas on a 15-yard TD pass, and then he found Lewis again on a 9-yard TD pass. The Cowboys responded in the 4th quarter with RB Marion Barber getting a 1-yard TD run. But the Jaguars scored again with Garrard scrambling 2 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The Cowboys replied with QB Jon Kitna making an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards difference was David Garrard's third touchdown pass compared to his fourth?",
