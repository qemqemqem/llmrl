    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping for their first win of the season, the Buccaneers flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 5 duel with the Philadelphia Eagles.  Tampa Bay would immediately trail in the first quarter as Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb hooked up with wide receiver Jeremy Maclin on a 51-yard touchdown pass.  Philadelphia would increase their lead in the second quarter with McNabb completing a 20-yard touchdown pass to fullback Leonard Weaver.  The Buccaneers would get on the board with quarterback Josh Johnson's 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kellen Winslow, but the Eagles would close out the first half with McNabb finding Maclin again on a 40-yard touchdown 40-yard touchdown pass. In the third quarter, Philadelphia would increase their lead with running back Brian Westbrook getting a 7-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles would then start off the fourth quarter with kicker David Akers nailing a 44-yard field goal.  Tampa Bay tried to rally as Johnson connected with Winslow again on a 9-yard touchdown pass, but Philadelphia closed out the game with defensive end Darren Howard tackling running back Cadillac Williams in his endzone for a safety.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Maclin's longest touchdown catch compared with his shortest?",
