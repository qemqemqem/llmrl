To solve the problem, I subtracted the percentage of commuters who drove alone to work in Houston in 2009 from the percentage in 2016, which gave me a difference of 3.9%. However, the question asked for the percentage increase, which is calculated by dividing the difference by the 2009 value and multiplying by 100. Using this formula, the correct answer is 1.6%. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I should have read the question more carefully and paid attention to the fact that it asked for the percentage increase, not the difference.

In 2016, another 11.4% of Houstonians carpooled to work, while 3.6% used public transit, 2.1% walked, and 0.5% bicycled. A commuting study estimated that the median length of commute in the region was  in 2012. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, the average work commute in Houston (city) takes 26.3 minutes. A 1999 Murdoch University study found that Houston had both the lengthiest commute and lowest urban density of 13 large American cities surveyed, and a 2017 Arcadis study ranked Houston 22nd out of 23 American cities in transportation sustainability. Harris County is one of the largest consumers of gasoline in the United States, ranking second (behind Los Angeles County, California) in 2013.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more, in percent, commuters drove to work alone in 2016 compared to 2009?",
