    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I calculated the difference between the percentage of females and males per 100. The percentage of females per 100 is 100 - 91.70 = 8.3 more than males per 100. Therefore, the answer is 8.3. \n\nI believe this is the most straightforward and accurate way to solve the problem.

This would require more calculations, but it could provide a more accurate answer.",
