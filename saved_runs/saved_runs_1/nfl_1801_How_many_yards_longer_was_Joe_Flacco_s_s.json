In  the 1st quarter the Browns took the early lead when kicker Phil Dawson made a 28-yard field goal, which didn't last very long after QB Joe Flacco found WR Anquan Boldin on an 8 and a 12-yard TD pass. After that the Browns replied and eventually got the lead back when RB Peyton Hillis made a 1-yard TD run, followed in the 4th quarter by QB Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson. Then the Browns fell behind when Flacco made a 27-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin, followed by kicker Billy Cundiff nailing a 49-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Joe Flacco's second touchdown pass compared to his first?",
