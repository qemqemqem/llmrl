    "problem_text": "Context:\nFor Week 2, the Cardinals flew to the Northwest to take on the defending NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks.  From the get-go, the Cardinals trailed, as the opposing RB Shaun Alexander to score a TD on a 2-yard run.  Then, Arizona allowed opposing QB Matt Hasselbeck to complete a 49-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson.  There wouldn't be anymore scoring by either team for the remainder of the half.  In the third quarter, the Cardinals finally got on the border with kicker Neil Rackers nailing a 43-yard field goal.  However, Seattle managed to put the game away with FB Mack Strong's 3-yard TD run.  The Cardinals would get a TD, with QB Kurt Warner completing a 40-yard pass to WR Bryant Johnson, but in the end, the Seahawks were the better team in this fight and made the Cardinals move to 1-1.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards long was Warner's pass to Johnson?",
