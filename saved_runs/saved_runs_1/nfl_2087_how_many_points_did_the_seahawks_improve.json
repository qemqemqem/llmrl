To solve the problem, I could have used algebra to find the difference between the current victory mark (6) and the previous victory mark (unknown). However, since the context states that the Seahawks surpassed their victory mark of the last 2 seasons, we can assume that their previous victory mark was 4 (2 seasons with 4 victories each). Therefore, the difference between the current and previous victory marks is 2, and the answer to the problem is 2.",

In the first quarter the Seahawks trailed early as RB Mike Goodson got a 6-yard TD run, followed by RB Jonathan Stewart getting a 3-yard TD run. They commanded the rest of the game with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 24-yard field goal, followed by RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run, then with Lofa Tatupu returning an interception 26 yards for a touchdown. The lead was extended with Lynch getting a 1 and a 22-yard TD run. With the win, not only did the Seahawks improve to 6-6, they surpassed their victory mark of the last 2 seasons.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many points did the seahawks improve by?",
