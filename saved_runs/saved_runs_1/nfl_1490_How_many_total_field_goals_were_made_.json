After a scoreless first quarter, Chiefs kicker Ryan Succop booted a 39-yard field goal for the only score of the half.In the third quarter, the Redskins took the lead with a 40-yard and a 28-yard field goal from kicker Shaun Suisham, but Kansas City tied it up with Succop's 46-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Succop gave the Chiefs the lead with a 46-yard and a 24-yard field, but it was the defense that closed the game out for Kansas City, as DE/OLB Tamba Hali sacked quarterback Todd Collins in his own end zone for a safety with under a minute to play.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total field goals were made?",
