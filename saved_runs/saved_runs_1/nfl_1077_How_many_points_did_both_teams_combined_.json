    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their road win over the Browns, the Texans went home, donned their \"Battle Red\" uniforms, and played in their very first Monday Night Football game in franchise history, as they played a Week 13 AFC South rematch with the Jacksonville Jaguars. In the first quarter, Houston drew first blood as QB Sage Rosenfels completed a 31-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, while kicker Kris Brown got a 38-yard field goal.  After a scoreless second quarter, the Texans increased their lead early in the third quarter as Brown got a 50-yard field goal.  The Jaguars would respond with kicker Josh Scobee getting a 29-yard field goal, yet Houston answered with Brown nailing a 20-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Houston began to pull away as rookie RB Steve Slaton got a 7-yard TD run.  Jacksonville would answer with RB Fred Taylor getting a 4-yard TD run, yet the Texans immediately replied as Slaton got a 40-yard TD run.  The Jaguars would close out the game with QB David Garrard completing an 18-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Williams. This was the first time that Houston hosted a football game on Monday night in 14 years.  The last Monday night game that was held in Houston was on November 21, 1994, in the Houston Astrodome when the Houston Oilers were defeated by the New York Giants 13-10.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did both teams combined score in the second quarter?",
