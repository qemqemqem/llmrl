    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Cards lost their fifth straight game to the undefeated Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football. The Cards came out smoking early as QB Matt Leinart for the second straight week threw two touchdown passes in the first quarter, connecting with WR's Bryant Johnson and Anquan Boldin.  Cards K Neil Rackers converted field goals of 41 and 28 yards respectively to give the Cards a seemingly insurmountable 20-0 halftime lead.  The Cards held Bears QB Rex Grossman in check, forcing him into six turnovers (four interceptions and two fumbles).  Bears K Robbie Gould drilled a 23-yard field goal midway through the third quarter for the Bears only offensive points of the night.  Cards K Rackers responded with a 29-yard field goal of his own to extend the lead to 23-3.  The Bears went on to score 21 unanswered points on defense and special teams, two fumble recoveries by Mike Brown and Charles Tillman respectively, and an 82-yard punt return touchdown by rookie Devin Hester.  Cards K Rackers was set up to win the game with a 40-yard field goal in the waning minutes, but the kick sailed wide left and they dropped to 1-5 on the season. The loss marked the first time in history that a team blew a 20-point lead to an opponent who did not score any offensive touchdowns. At the post-game press conference, coach Dennis Green erupted at reporters. \"The Bears are who we thought they were! That's why we took the damn field! Now, if you want to crown them, then crown their ass! But they are who we thought they were, and we let them off the hook!\" He then smacked the microphone before storming out of the room. The clip quickly became a highlight of sports shows and popular online. (An edited version of the clip is being used in current Coors Light advertisements).Chicago Bears QB Rex Grossman told Cardinals QB Matt Leinart after the game that Arizona deserved to have won that game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards of field goals did Neil Rackers convert?",
