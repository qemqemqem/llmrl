    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Lions went home for a Week 8 duel with the Washington Redskins. This was the first ever regular season game at Ford Field that had failed to sell out by the 72-hour deadline and was, therefore, subject to local television blackout. In the first quarter, Detroit trailed early as Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham got a 25-yard field goal. In what would be the first time in the season the Lions scored during the first quarter, RB Rudi Johnson got an 11-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Detroit increased its lead as kicker Jason Hanson got a 43-yard field goal.  Washington closed out the half with Suisham getting a 47-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Redskins regained the lead as Suisham made a 45-yard field goal, along with QB Jason Campbell completing a 50-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss.  In the fourth quarter, the Lions' struggles continued as Moss returned a punt 80 yards for a touchdown.  Detroit tried to rally as QB Dan Orlovsky completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. However, Washington closed out the game with Suisham nailing a 42-yard field goal. On October 28, the Lions discussed a contract with veteran quarterback Daunte Culpepper. He signed with the Lions on November 3 and played 4 games before suffering a shoulder injury.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were longer than 40-yards in length?",
