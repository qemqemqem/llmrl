    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their last-second road loss to the Falcons, the Bears went home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played a Week 7 NFC North duel with the Minnesota Vikings.  In the first quarter, Chicago trailed early as Vikings RB Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run.  The Bears responded with QB Kyle Orton completing an 18-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen, along with RB Garrett Wolfe returning a blocked punt 17 yards for a touchdown.  Minnesota would answer with QB Gus Frerotte completing a 24-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe.  In the second quarter, it was back and forth.  Chicago kicker Robbie Gould would get a 26-yard field goal, while Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell got a 42-yard field goal.  Bears rookie CB Zackary Bowman would recover a fumble from Minnesota's endzone for a touchdown, while Vikings RB Chester Taylor got a 1-yard TD run.  Chicago closed out the half as Gould got a 48-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the high-scoring mayhem continued as WR Rashied Davis recovered a fumble within Minnesota's endzone for a touchdown.  The Vikings would reply with Peterson getting a 54-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Bears increased their lead as Orton completed a 51-yard TD pass to WR Marty Booker.  In the fourth quarter, Chicago continued its run as rookie RB Matt Fort&#233; got a 1-yard TD run.  Minnesota tried to rally as Longwell nailed a 23-yard field goal, along with Frerotte completing a 5-yard TD pass to former Bears WR Bernard Berrian.  Fortunately, Chicago's defense got the game-winning interception to seal the deal. With the win, the Bears went into their bye week at 4-3. The 89 combined points became the highest single-game scoring total in the history of the Bears/Vikings rivalry.
