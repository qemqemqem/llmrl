Value added by the British woollen industry was 14.1% in 1801.  Cotton factories in Britain numbered approximately 900 in 1797.  In 1760 approximately one-third of cotton cloth manufactured in Britain was exported, rising to two-thirds by 1800.  In 1781 cotton spun amounted to 5.1 million pounds, which increased to 56 million pounds by 1800.  In 1800 less than 0.1% of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in Britain.  In 1788 there were 50,000 spindles in Britain, rising to 7 million over the next 30 years.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more percent was the value added by the cotton textile industry in 1831 compared to 1801?",
