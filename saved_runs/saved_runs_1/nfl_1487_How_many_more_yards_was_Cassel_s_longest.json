    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill searching for their first win of the season, the Chiefs flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 3 interconference duel with the Philadelphia Eagles. Kansas City would trail early in the first quarter as Eagles running back LeSean McCoy got a 5-yard touchdown run and quarterback Kevin Kolb got a 1-yard touchdown run. The Chiefs would get on the board with quarterback Matt Cassel's 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mark Bradley, but Philadelphia came right back with Kolb's 64-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson and kicker David Akers' 29-yard field goal. Kansas City's deficit would increase as Akers nailed a 38-yard field goal in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles would put the game away with Kolb's 35-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Celek. Afterwards, the Chiefs would end the game with Cassel's 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bobby Wade.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more yards was Cassel's longest TD pass over his shortest one?",
