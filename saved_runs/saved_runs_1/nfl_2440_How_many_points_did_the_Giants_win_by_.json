The San Francisco 49ers were looking to avenge their playoff loss against the Giants, and had just come off back-to-back landslide victories against the Jets and Bills. However, the Giants defense allowed only one field goal and the Giants ultimately won the game 26-3, sending the 49ers to their first and only home loss of the season. With the win, the Giants improved to 4-2. Also, with the Eagles' loss to the Lions earlier in the day, the Giants gained sole possession of first place in the NFC East.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Giants win by?",
