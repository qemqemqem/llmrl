The problem stated that there was a positive rate of 84 immigrants in 2009, which was the first time since collecting data in 2002. Therefore, the answer is 7, which represents the number of years after 2002 when there was a positive rate of immigration. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have organized the information in a table or a graph to make it easier to visualize the trend of immigration over the years. Additionally, I could have calculated the net migration rate for each year to get a better understanding of the overall trend.",

In 2009 there were 1,820 arrivals and 1,736 departures, for a positive rate of 84 immigrants. This was the first time since collecting data in 2002, there was a positive rate. Data on arrivals and departures collected by the Nauruan Customs and Immigration Office is not available, so specific immigration data is unavailable. As of the 2011 census, 57% of the population over 15 years old were legally or de facto married, 35% were never married, while 7% were either widowed, separated, or divorced. There are 1,647 households in Nauru, making an average household size of 6.0 persons per household.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after 2002 was there a positive rate?",
