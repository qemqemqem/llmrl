    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their record-setting win over the Lions, the Panthers flew to the Georgia Dome for a Week 12 NFC South rematch with the Atlanta Falcons.  In the first quarter, Carolina trailed early as Falcons kicker Jason Elam made a 23-yard field goal, while WR Harry Douglas got a 7-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Panthers continued to trail as RB Michael Turner got a 1-yard TD run.  Carolina would close out the half as kicker John Kasay got a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Panthers began to make the game interesting. RB DeAngelo Williams would get a 5-yard TD run, followed by Kasay nailing a 21-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Atlanta replied with Turner getting a 4-yard TD run.  Carolina answered with QB Jake Delhomme getting a 12-yard TD run (followed up by Williams' 2-point conversion run), but the Falcons responded with Turner's 1-yard TD run, along with Douglas returning a punt 61 yards for a touchdown.  The Panthers tried to come back as Delhomme completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Muhsin Muhammad.  However, Atlanta pulled away as Turner got a 16-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many rushing touchdown from 1 yard out were scored?",
