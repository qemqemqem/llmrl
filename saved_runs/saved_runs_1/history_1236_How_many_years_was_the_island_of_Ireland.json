During the Great Famine, from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30%. One million Irish died of starvation and/or disease and another 1.5 million emigrated, mostly to the United States. This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in a constant population decline up to the 1960s.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years was the island of Ireland part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland?",
