Carolina answered with a touchdown by Fozzy Whitaker which tied the game again. The Patriots later scored with another Stephen Gostkowski field goal. Devin Funchess caught a ten-yard pass from Newton to give the Panthers a 17-13 lead. With four seconds remaining in the half Gostkowski kicked a 58-yard field goal, making the halftime score 17-16. Carolina had the only score in the third quarter with a Funchess touchdown but Gano missed the extra point. The Panthers started the fourth quarter with Cam Newton rushing for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 30-16. New England managed to score twice, tying the game at 30. With seconds left, Graham Gano kicked the game winning field goal. The Panthers won 33-30 (their first win in Foxborough since 1995) and improved to 3-1.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many points were they ahead at halftime?",
