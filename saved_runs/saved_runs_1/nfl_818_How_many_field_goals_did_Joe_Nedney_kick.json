    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap an eight-game losing streak, the 49ers flew to the University of Phoenix Stadium for a Week 12 NFC West rematch with the Arizona Cardinals. In the first quarter, the Niners trailed early as Cardinals QB Kurt Warner completed a 28-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald. San Francisco responded with QB Trent Dilfer completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. In the second quarter, the 49ers took the lead with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 19-yard field goal & RB Frank Gore getting an 11-yard TD run.  However, Arizona regained the lead with RB Marcel Shipp getting a 1-yard TD run & Warner hooking up with Fitzgerald again on a 48-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, the Niners retook the lead as Dilfer completed a 57-yard TD pass to WR Arnaz Battle for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, it was back-and-forth as Cardinals QB Tim Rattay (a former 49er) completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Ben Patrick, while Gore managed to get a 35-yard TD run. Afterwards, Arizona ended regulation with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 19-yard TD field goal. In overtime, the ball went back and forth between the Cardinals and the 49ers. When the Cardinals had the ball, Kurt Warner threw the ball to WR Sean Morey who appeared to have a sure touchdown, but was run down by 49ers rookie linebacker Patrick Willis. Kicker Neil Rackers missed a field goal, and the 49ers got the ball back. After a three and out, punter Andy Lee pinned the Cardinals close to their own endzone. San Francisco lifted their demons with stripping Warner in his endzone and LB Tully Banta-Cain landed on it for the touchdown and the win. With the win, not only did the 49ers improve to 3-8, it also snapped their dreaded eight-game losing streak. It also gave them a season-sweep over the Cardinals. It would also improve their overtime record under head coach Mike Nolan to 3-0. With the victory, the 49ers improved to 2-0 against the Cardinals and 1-8 against everyone else this season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Joe Nedney kick?",
