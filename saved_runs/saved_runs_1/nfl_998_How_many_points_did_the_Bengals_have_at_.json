In the first quarter, Cincinnati's struggles continued as Texans WR Jacoby Jones returned a punt 73 yards for a touchdown.  The Bengals responded with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 43-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Houston increased its lead as QB Matt Schaub completed a 6-yard TD pass to WR David Anderson.  Cincinnati closed out the half with Graham nailing a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Texans began to pull away as Schaub completed a 7-yard and a 39-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter.  In the fourth quarter, Houston sealed the win with RB Steve Slaton getting a 20-yard TD run. With yet another loss, the Bengals would fall to 0-8 and start a season with such a record for the first time since 1994.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Bengals have at half time?",
