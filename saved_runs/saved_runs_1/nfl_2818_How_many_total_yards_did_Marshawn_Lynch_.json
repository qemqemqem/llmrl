To calculate the total number of yards Marshawn Lynch rushed for on his two touchdown runs, we need to look for additional information in the passage. The passage states that Lynch scored two rushing touchdowns in the game, one from 3 yards out and the other from 5 yards out. Therefore, the total number of yards Lynch rushed for on his two touchdown runs is 8. To solve the problem better, I should have carefully read the passage and paid attention to the details provided about Lynch's touchdowns.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill looking for their first win of the season 7 games through, the Raiders headed up to the Pacific Northwest to take on the defending champion Seattle Seahawks. The Raiders received the opening kickoff and immediately scored on their first possession by means of a 48-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. Up 3-0, the Oakland defense took the field and was unable to stop the Seahawks from responding. Seattle took advantage of the multiple flags against the defense as Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson facilitated a 72-yard drive to score the game's first touchdown on a 3 yard run by Lynch. Both teams went 3-and-out on their next offensive possession before Derek Carr was picked off by Seahawks LB Bruce Irvin who returned it 35 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Carr was intercepted again, this time by Richard Sherman. Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka added a field goal to put the Seahawks up 17-3. Meanwhile, the Raiders were unable to stop turning the ball over. After Hauschka's field goal, on the ensuing kickoff, T.J. Carrie's return was fumbled at the Oakland 25 and recovered by Hauschka himself at the 31 yard line. Though the Seahawks were unable to turn it into any points on Hauschka's missed field goal, Lynch picked up his second rushing touchdown of the day later in the quarter, this time from 5 yards out, and the Seahawks led 24-3 at halftime. To start the second half, however, the Raiders scored in less than a minute by blocking Jon Ryan's punt and recovering it in the end zone for a touchdown. With 5 minutes left in the third, Carr connected with tight end Mychal Rivera on a 1-yard touchdown pass to bring Oakland to within 7. Hauschka added two more field goals early in the fourth quarter and the Seahawks had a 13-point advantage with just over 9 minutes remaining. It took the Raiders until two plays after the 2-minute warning to score. Carr hooked up with Rivera again on another 1-yard touchdown pass and left it up to an onside kick to determine the outcome. Unfortunately for Oakland, their onside kick try was recovered by Seattle's Jermaine Kearse, and the Seahawks hung on to claim the victory, 30-24. With the loss, the Raiders dropped to 0-8 on the season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards did Marshawn Lynch rush for on his touchdown runs?",
