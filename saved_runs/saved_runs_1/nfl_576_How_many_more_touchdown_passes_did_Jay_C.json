    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off an impressive divisional road win over the Chiefs, the Broncos went home for a Week 11 Monday Night intraconference duel with the Tennessee Titans.  In the first quarter, Denver drew first blood with QB Jay Cutler completing a 48-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley, along with WR/PR Glenn Martinez returning a punt 80 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, the Titans got on the board with QB Vince Young completing a 21-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Jones.  Afterwards, the Broncos regained some of their lead with kicker Jason Elam getting a 21-yard and a 39-yard field goal.  Tennessee would end the half with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 56-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver responded with Cutler completing a 41-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall.  The Titans would reply with Young getting a 4-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Tennessee drew closer as Bironas nailed a 37-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Broncos got the victory with rookie RB Andre Hall getting a 62-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more touchdown passes did Jay Cutler make over Vince Young?",
