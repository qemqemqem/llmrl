    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off of their bye week, the Steelers traveled to East Rutherford, NJ to take on the Jets.  The Jets scored first in the first quarter when Nick Folk scored a 25-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead for the only score of that period.  The Steelers managed to tie it at first in the 2nd quarter followed by taking the lead with 2 other field goals as Suisham kicked field goals from 46, 33, and 48 yards out for scores of 3-3, 6-3, and 9-3 respectively.  The Jets tried to rally as Folk nailed a 39-yard field goal for a 9-6 score at halftime.  In the 2nd half, it was all Steleers as they pulled away when Ben Roethlisberger found Emmanuel Sanders on a 55-yard touchdown pass for a 16-6 lead in the 3rd quarter which was then followed up by Suisham's 32-yard field goal in the 4th quarter for a final score of 19-6.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards of field goals did Suisham kick in total?",
