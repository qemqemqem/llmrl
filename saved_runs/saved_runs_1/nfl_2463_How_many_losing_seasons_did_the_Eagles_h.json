Thus this season became their 3rd losing season under Andy Reid as the Eagles were swept by the Cowboys for the first time since 2009.  Regardless that the Eagles were now 0-3 with Foles as a starter, Andy named him the team's starting QB for the remainder of the season. Also with the loss, the Eagles were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many losing seasons did the Eagles have under Andy Reid?",
