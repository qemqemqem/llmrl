    "problem_text": "Context:\nWashington traveled to Baltimore for an inter-conference game against the Ravens. Washington won the toss, and elected to receive the opening kick. Washington quarterback Jason Campbell was intercepted early in the drive by Ravens safety Ed Reed. Baltimore running back Le'Ron McClain converted the turnover into points when he scored a rushing TD on the ensuing Ravens possession. Later in the first quarter, the Ravens defense struck for a defensive touchdown when Ed Reed recovered a fumble from Washington running back Clinton Portis. In the third quarter, Ravens kicker Matt Stover extended the Ravens lead with a 32-yard field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Washington got on the board with a Shaun Suisham 43-yard field goal. Baltimore running back Willis McGahee fumbled on the Raven's next possession, and the Redskins cut the Ravens lead to 17-10 on a touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle-El. The Redskins defense was unable to come up with another stop, and the Ravens ended their next drive with quarterback Joe Flacco throwing a touchdown pass to wide receiver Derrick Mason.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many turnovers did Ed Reed have in this game?",
