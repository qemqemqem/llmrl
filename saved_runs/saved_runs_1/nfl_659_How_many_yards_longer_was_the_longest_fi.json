    "problem_text": "Context:\nAttempting to rebound from their overtime road loss to the Redskins in Week 1, the Dolphins hosted the Dallas Cowboys in Week 2. In the first quarter, Miami got the first points of the game when kicker Jay Feely converted a 37-yard field goal. The Cowboys responded with a 26-yard field goal by Nick Folk. In the second quarter, Dallas took the lead on a 1-yard Marion Barber III touchdown run. Feely made a 45-yard field goal attempt as the half ended with the Cowboys leading 10-6. In the third quarter, Miami regained the lead with quarterback Trent Green completing an 18-yard TD pass to wide receiver Marty Booker. However, the Cowboys jumped back out in front with quarterback Tony Romo completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Curtis, which was followed by Folk kicking a 28-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Dallas extended the lead with Folk's 47-yard field goal and Romo's 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens. The Dolphins tried to come back as Green completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Derek Hagan, but the Cowboys put the game away with Barber's 40-yard touchdown run as Miami fell to 0-2 and 0-2 against NFC opponents.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was the longest field goal to the second longest field goal?",
