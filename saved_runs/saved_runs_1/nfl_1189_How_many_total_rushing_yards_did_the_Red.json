    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Eagles dropped a divisional matchup to a Washington Redskins team that was coming off an upset win over the Dallas Cowboys.  Philadelphia enjoyed a fast start, with Donovan McNabb marching the Eagles on a 12-play opening drive, ending with a 9-yard touchdown by Brian Westbrook.  After a Washington three-and-out, DeSean Jackson reversed the field andreturned a punt 68 yards for a touchdown to give Philadelphia a 14-0 advantage.  After a 50-yard field goal miss by David Akers on Philadelphia's next drive, the Redskins began their comeback.  They chipped away at the lead with three second-quarter field goals by Shaun Suisham.  In the third quarter, Washington took the lead on a trick play, with receiver Antwaan Randle El completing an 18-yard touchdown pass to tight end Chris Cooley. Clinton Portis scored on a 4-yard run for Washington, making it 23-14.  Midway through the final quarter, the Eagles had 2nd and 1 from the Washington 2-yard line, but were forced to settle for a field goal.  A successful fourth down conversion by Portis ended the game.  The Philadelphia running defense gave up 203 yards, 144 of them to Portis.  Westbrook learned after the game that he had broken his ribs during the first quarter.  With the loss, Philadelphia fell to 2-3 in the NFC East.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total rushing yards did the Redskins have?",
