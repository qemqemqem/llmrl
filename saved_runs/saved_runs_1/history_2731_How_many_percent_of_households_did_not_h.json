Therefore, the percentage of households that did not have two income earners can be calculated by subtracting 42 from 100, which gives 58. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have used a formula to calculate the percentage of households that did not have two income earners. The formula would be:\n\nPercentage of households with one income earner = 100% - Percentage of households with two income earners\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the percentage of households with one income earner as:\n\nPercentage of households with one income earner = 100% - 42% = 58%\n\nThis formula can be useful when we have to calculate the percentage of a population that falls into a certain category based on the percentage of the population that falls into another category.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn 2006, Household income in the United States was $43,318 per household ($26,000 per household member) with 42% of households having two income earners. Meanwhile, the median income of the average American age 25+ was roughly $32,000 ($39,000 if only counting those employed full-time between the ages of 25 to 64) in 2005. According to the CIA the Gini coefficient which measures income inequality (the higher the less equal the income distribution) was clocked at 45.0 in 2005, compared to 32.0 in the European Union and 28.3 in Germany.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percent of households did not have two income earners?",
