By the end of the season, 1,701,152 fans had attended. In 1991, the Blue Jays became the first MLB team to attract over Major League Baseball attendance records, with an attendance of 4,001,526, followed by 4,028,318 in 1992. Each of those records were broken in 1993 by the expansion 1993 Colorado Rockies season, although the Blue Jays 1993 attendance of 4,057,947 stood as an AL record for 12 years until it was broken by the 2005 New York Yankees season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more people attended Blue Jays games in 1991 compared to 1977?",
