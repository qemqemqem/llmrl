    "problem_text": "Context:\nSitting at 1-1, the Bengals traveled to Washington to face the Redskins, with rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III (RG3) making his home debut. On the first play from scrimmage, Bengals' wide receiver and former college quarterback Mohamad Sanu launched a 73-yard touchdown to AJ Green to give Cincinnati an early touchdown advantage. Bengals third-year quarterback Andy Dalton started his day with a 0-yard interception touchdown by Rob Jackson that tied the game at seven, but soon went on an impressive tear the rest of the game. Dalton rebounded with a 48-yard touchdown to Armon Binns, part of 17 unanswered points by the Bengals that gave them a 24-7 lead late in the first half. Billy Cundiff would add a late field goal that made the score 24-10, Cincinnati, at half time. The Redskins made a run at the Bengals in the third quarter, scoring back-to-back touchdowns on a  touchdown run by Alfred Morris and a two-yard pass from Griffin to Santana Moss, which tied the game at 24. However, on the first two fourth-quarter drives for Cincinnati, Dalton gave his team the lead back&#8212;firing two touchdowns, one to Jermaine Gresham from six yards away, the other to Andrew Hawkins who dashed and weaved his way for a 59-yard score that put Cincinnati once again up 14, 38-24. RGIII would scramble and dive his way into the end zone with three-and-a-half minutes remaining, but the Skins' comeback effort fell short as Griffin's hail mary was knocked away on the final play of regulation.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were scored in the fourth quarter?",
