    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter getting swept by the Bears, the Vikings flew to Ford Field for an NFC North rematch with the Detroit Lions. In the first quarter, RB Artose Pinner (a former Lion) helped Minnesota gain an early lead with a 3-yard and a 4-yard TD run. In the second quarter, QB Brad Johnson got a 3-yard TD run, yet it was followed up with a failed 2-point conversion. Detroit would retaliate with DB Jamar Fletcher returning an interception 88 yards for a touchdown, while kicker Jason Hanson kicked a 53-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes got a 30-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell, yet Detroit's Hanson nailed a 45-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Pinner helped wrap the game up with a 1-yard TD run. Even though Lions QB Jon Kitna would complete a 23-yard TD pass to RB Kevin Jones, Minnesota held on to sweep Detroit. With the win, the Vikings improved to 6-7.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards total did Artose Pinner run for touchdowns in the first quarter?",
