    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn yet another game where Houston did not score in the 1st quarter, the Titans took an early lead with a 35-yard field goal from Brinkley to lead 3-0 with 10:28 left. The Texans got their first scoring play of the day with a Bullock 30 yard field goal to tie the game 3-3 with 7:41 left in the 2nd. Following a three-and-out for Tennessee with 2 penalties (one on the punt), Houston wasted no time to score the game's first touchdown following a 34-yard rush from Foster to lead 10-3 with 6:12 left in the half. Bullock kicked a 29-yard field goal to extend the Texans' lead to 13-3 going into halftime. The Titans received the ball to start off the 2nd half, but Mettenberger was sacked and fumbled the ball and was recovered by Watt. Houston quickly capitalized on the turnover with a 5-yard pass from Fitzpatrick to Foster to lead 20-3 with 12:39 left in the 3rd. The Texans scored on their next possession to lead 27-3 with 5:47 left in the 3rd. The Titans scored their first touchdown of the game on their next possession with a 6-yard pass from Mettenberger to Walker. With a failed two-point conversion, Tennessee trailed 9-27 with 2:17 left in the third. On the Houston's 3rd play of the 4th quarter, Bullock kicked a 49-yard field goal to extend the lead to 30-9 with 14:17 left to play. The Titans scored a touchdown with 1:02 left to trail 30-16. Blue recovered the onside kick, with Fitzpatrick taking a kneel on the next 2 plays to end the game. With the win, the Texans went to 4-4, snapped their three-game losing streak and held onto 2nd place in the AFC South.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many points did the texans beat the titans by?",
