    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Bengals flew to the RCA Dome for a Monday Night game with the Indianapolis Colts.  In the first quarter, things started slowly, with Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri kicking a 30-yard field goal, which Bengal kicker Shayne Graham countered with a 27-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Indianapolis took the lead when quarterback Peyton Manning threw a 4-yard touchdown to wide receiver Marvin Harrison. Running back Rudi Johnson answered with a 12-yard touchdown run. Manning and Harrison scored again with a 3-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, Graham kicked a 30-yard field goal. The four-point Colt lead would be as close as Cincinnati could pull, as Manning completed two more touchdowns: a 1-yard pass to Harrison, and an 18-yard pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne. In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati's only score was a Graham 28-yard field goal. The Colts' Vinatieri added a final score, a 44-yard field goal, to hand the Colts an 18-point victory. The loss dropped the Bengals' record to 8-6, and delivered their division rival, the Baltimore Ravens, the AFC Central crown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were made?",
