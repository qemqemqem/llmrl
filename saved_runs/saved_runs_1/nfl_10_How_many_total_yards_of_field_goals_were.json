    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off of their home win over the Lions, the Cardinals flew to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome for a Week 12 fight with the Minnesota Vikings.  This game was noted for the return of head coach Green to Minnesota where he coached from 1992 to 2001.  On the very first play of the first quarter, RB J.J. Arrington returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown.  The Vikings would respond with RB Chester Taylor's 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Cards kicker Neil Rackers gave Arizona a 21-yard and a 50-yard field goal for a decent lead.  However, the Vikes took the lead with QB Brad Johnson's 17-yard TD pass to WR Marcus Robinson.  In the third quarter, more of the Cardinals' year-long ineffectiveness showed as Johnson completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Billy McMullen, while kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Minnesota improved its lead on Johnson's 3-yard TD pass to FB Jeff Dugan.  Afterwards, Arizona tried to fight back as Strong Safety Adrian Wilson returned a fumble 99 yards for a touchdown, yet it was followed up by a failed two-point conversion.  Afterwards, QB Matt Leinart completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin.  Afterwards, the Vikings wrapped up the game and won.  With the loss, the Cardinals fell to 2-9.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards of field goals were made in the game?",
