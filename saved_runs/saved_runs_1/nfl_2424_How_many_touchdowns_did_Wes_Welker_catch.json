    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win in Buffalo against the Bills, the Patriots returned to Foxborough to host the Denver Broncos. This was the 13th Brady-Manning meeting between quarterbacks since 2001, and the 17th overall meeting between Manning and the Patriots. The Broncos started off strong, driving to their own 47, but after a 43-yard completion to Demaryius Thomas, Sterling Moore (the AFC Championship Game hero from the year before) punched the ball loose, recovered, and returned it 14 yards to the Patriots 17. Two possessions later, the Patriots marched 84 yards in 12 plays, drawing first blood on an 8-yard touchdown pass to Welker. The Broncos countered, driving 80 yards in 10 plays. On 3rd-and-6, Manning threw an incomplete pass intended for Eric Decker, but McCourty was called for pass interference, moving the ball to the 1-yard line. On the very next play, Manning hit Joel Dreessen for a 1-yard touchdown pass a few plays into the second quarter. However, the Patriots reeled off 24 unanswered points. The ambush began on the Patriots ensuing possession, with the Patriots marching 80 yards in 14 plays, scoring on Vereen's 1-yard rushing touchdown. Following a Broncos punt, the Patriots marched on a marathon 16 play, 93-yard drive to the Broncos 1-yard line, but on 3rd-and-goal Brandon Bolden was tackled for a 4-yard loss by Von Miller and the Patriots settled for a 23-yard field goal by Gostkowski, increasing their lead to 17-7. Manning took a knee and the game went to halftime. After both teams punted to open the second half, the Patriots drained the Broncos already tired defense for a 16 play 95-yard drive, scoring on a 1-yard quarterback sneak, widening the lead to 24-7. On the first play of the Broncos next drive, Manning was strip-sacked by Ninkovich with Wilfork recovering at the Broncos 14. After two penalties, Ridley scored on an 8-yard touchdown, making the score 31-7 and the anticipated tight game a blowout. The Broncos responded by racing 90 yards in 10 plays with Manning throwing a 2-yard touchdown pass to Decker, trimming the deficit to 31-14. Early in the 4th quarter, the Patriots drove to the Broncos 46, but back-to-back sacked by Derek Wolfe and Miller, respectively forced the Patriots to punt. The Broncos drove to the Patriots 47, but turned the ball over on downs when Manning threw an incomplete pass on 4th-and-1. The Patriots responded by driving to the Patriots 37, but Brady was sacked by Elvis Dumervil for an 11-yard loss on 4th-and-5, with Nate Solder recovering Brady's fumble, preventing it from becoming a disaster.  The Broncos took over at the Patriots 43 and raced 43 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Stokley, closing the gap to 31-21 with 6:43 remaining. The Patriots next drive lasted only three plays: a 4-yard rush by Ridley (which set a new career in high in rushing yards with 129), a 20-yard run by Ridley on the next play, and Miller stripping Ridley with Mike Adams recovering at Broncos 32. The Broncos stormed to the Patriots 14-yard line in just 5 plays, but Willis McGahee was stripped by Ninkovich with Jermaine Cunningham recovering with 3:48 remaining, halting the Broncos' rally attempt. The Patriots subsequently ran out the clock and won the game. Tom Brady improved his head-to-head record against Peyton Manning to 9-4. With the legendary QB battle between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning renewed, the Patriots would take the first game as the team improved to 3-2.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Wes Welker catch?",
