Witten's 59-yard day against the Texans left him just 46 yards shy of the No. 2 position currently held by Shannon Sharpe with 10,060 career receiving yards. Tony Gonzalez leads all tight ends in career receiving yards at 15,127, respectively. The Cowboys four-game winning streak was their first since 2011, and their best start since 2008.\n\nQuestion:\nThe Cowboys four-game winning streak was their greatest since?",
