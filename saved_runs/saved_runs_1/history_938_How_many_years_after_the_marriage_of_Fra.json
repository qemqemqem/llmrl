They arrived there in August 1665, and on 17 September 1669 Jarret married the twelve-year-old Marie Perrot in \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans.  He was awarded a land grant on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River on 29 October 1672 in a seigneury called Verch\u00e8res, and thereafter continued to increase his land holdings.  The couple was to have twelve children, the fourth of whom was Marie-Madeleine, born in Verch\u00e8res on 3 March 1678 and baptised that 17 April. The seigneury underwent periodic Iroquois raids.  In 1690 the matron of Verch\u00e8res took command of a successful defense against an Iroquois assault on the stockade there.  By 1692 the Iroquois had killed the Jarrets' son Fran\u00e7ois-Michel and two successive husbands of their daughter Marie-Jeanne. Before she performed this courageous act, she usually worked in the family field during her spare time.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after the marriage of Fran\u00e7ois Jarret was his daughter Marie-Madeleine born?",

We also know that their daughter Marie-Madeleine was born on 3 March 1678. We can subtract the year of their marriage from the year of their daughter's birth to find the number of years between the two events.",
