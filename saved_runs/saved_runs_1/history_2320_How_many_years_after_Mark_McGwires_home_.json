I found that Bonds surpassed McGwire's record of 70 home runs in 1998 by hitting 73 home runs in 2001. Therefore, the answer to the question is 3, as Bonds beat McGwire's record three years later. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have taken notes while reading the context to keep track of the important information.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn 2001, the Giants were eliminated from playoff contention on the next-to-last day of the season. Slugging shortstop Rich Aurilia put up stellar numbers (37 HR, 97 RBI, .324 BA) in support of Bonds, who once again gave fans something to cheer about with his single-season record 73 home runs, surpassing Mark McGwires 70 in 1998. The pitching staff was good but not great, with Russ Ort\u00edz (17\u20139, 3.29) leading a staff that also had Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez (13\u201315, 5.24) and Kirk Rueter (14\u201312, 4.42). Shawn Estes and Mark Gardner had subpar years, but a notable late-season acquisition from the Pirates was superstar starter Jason Schmidt (7\u20131, 3.39). Robb Nen continued as a dominant closer (45 saves, 3.01 ERA).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after Mark McGwires home run record did Bonds beat it?",
