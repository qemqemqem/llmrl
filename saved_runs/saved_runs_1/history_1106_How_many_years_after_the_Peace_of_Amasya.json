Therefore, 1612 - 1555 = 57. \n\nI believe this is the most straightforward and efficient way to solve the problem. However, if the dates were not explicitly given, I would have needed to do some additional research to find the dates of the two treaties.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nWhen the order was restored, Murad Pasha marched against Abbas I who was in Tabriz in 1610. Although the two armies met in  Ac\u0131\u00e7ay, north of Tabriz, no engagement or action took place. Due to the problems in the logistics, supply chain and the approaching winter Murad Pasha withdrew his forces to Diyarbak\u0131r. While being engaged in diplomatic correspondence with Abbas I for peace and preparing his army for another campaign at the same time he died on 5 August 1611 when he was older than 90. Nasuh Pasha was appointed as the new grand vizier and the commander of the eastern armies. He sued for peace, too, and accepted the proposal of the Safevid side in 1611. The Treaty of Nasuh Pasha was signed on 20 November 1612. The agreement secured the 1555 borders envisaged by the Peace of Amasya. Shah Abbas however, committed himself to send 200 bales of raw silk annually.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after the Peace of Amasya was signed was the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha signed?",
