The Iranian army took advantage of its conflicts with the Communist Party, Toudeh, to commit massacres. Later in Arabistan, new independent or autonomist parties came into being: the \"Arabistan Liberation Front\" in 1956; the \"National Front for the Liberation of Arabistan\" and the \"Arab Gulf\" in 1960; In 1967, the \"Arabistan Liberation Front\" became the \"Al Ahwaz Liberation Front\". Sporadic Arab insurgency in Khuzestan continued through the 1950s, but reduced in the final decade of Pahlavy rule .\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did these events span?",
