    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a three-game losing streak, the Bills went home for a Week 11 MNF duel with the Cleveland Browns.  In the first quarter, Buffalo struggled early as early interceptions from QB Trent Edwards helped Browns kicker Phil Dawson get a 40-yard and a 33-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Cleveland increased their lead as WR/KR Joshua Cribbs got a 2-yard TD run.  The Bills answered as Edwards completed an 18-yard TD pass to RB Marshawn Lynch, along with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 26-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Browns answered with Dawson getting a 43-yard field.  Buffalo replied with Lindell getting a 31-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Cleveland greatly answered as RB Jerome Harrison got a 72-yard TD run. The Bills immediately replied as rookie CB Leodis McKelvin returned a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown.  The Browns responded as Dawson got a 22-yard field goal.  Buffalo took the lead as Edwards got a 1-yard TD run.  Cleveland regained the lead as Dawson nailed a 56-yard field goal.  The Bills' Lindell missed a 47-yard field goal wide right.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was Dawson's longest field goal?",
