The auction that took place in June 2012 was followed by LTE tests in several cities, tourist locations, and international conference venues.

Therefore, the time difference between the auction and the commercial launch of LTE services is one year. \n\nTo solve this problem, I carefully read the context and identified the relevant information related to the launch of LTE service in Brazil.

At that time, according to Anatel (the national telecommunications agency), there were 667 devices in the country. The number of devices rose to 6,700 in the next year, to 30,000 in 1992. In November 2007 3G services were launched, and increased rapidly to almost 90% of the population in 2012 and the agreements signed as part of the auction specify a 3G coverage obligation of 100% of population by 2019. After the auction that took place in June 2012, LTE tests were undertaken in several cities, tourist locations and international conference venues. The first LTE-compatible devices became available in the local market and LTE services was commercially launched in 2013. Under the 4G licence terms, operators were required to have commercial networks in all twelve state capitals which are acting as host cities for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after the auction was LTE service commercially launched?",
