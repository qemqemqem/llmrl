Houston would trail in the first quarter as Jets kicker Jay Feely nailed a 24-yard field goal.  The Texans' deficit would increase in the second quarter as quarterback Mark Sanchez completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chansi Stuckey.  Things only got worse for Houston in the third quarter when running back Thomas Jones scored on a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Texans would get on the board as safety Dominique Barber returned a fumble 48 yards for a touchdown, but New York would seal the win with Jones' 38-yard touchdown run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Dominique Barber score?",
