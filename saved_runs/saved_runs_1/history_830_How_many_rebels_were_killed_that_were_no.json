To solve the problem, I added the number of rebels killed at Dussindale (3,000) to the number of rebels hanged after the battle (30-300) and subtracted the number of rebels executed by Warwick before entering Norwich (49). This gives a range of 2,981 to 3,251 rebels killed or hanged. However, the passage does not provide a specific number for the rebels killed or hanged who were not part of Warwick's army, so the answer is still an estimate. To solve the problem better, I could have paid closer attention to the numbers provided in the passage and double-checked my calculations.",

The morning after the battle, 28 August, rebels were hanged at the Oak of Reformation and outside the Magdalen Gate. Estimates of the number vary from 30 to 300. Warwick had already executed 49 rebels when he had entered Norwich a few days before. There is only one attested incident in which the rebels had killed in cold blood: one of Northampton's Italian mercenaries had been hanged following his capture. Kett was captured at the village of Swannington the night after the battle and taken, together with his brother William, to the Tower of London to await trial for treason. Found guilty, the brothers were returned to Norwich at the beginning of December. Kett was hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle on 7 December 1549; on the same day William was hanged from the west tower of Wymondham Abbey.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many rebels were killed that were not part of Warwick's army?",
