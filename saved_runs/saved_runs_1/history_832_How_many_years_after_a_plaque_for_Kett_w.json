    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I subtracted the year the plaque was unveiled (1949) from the year the memorial march took place. The memorial march took place on the anniversary of Kett's death, so the year was not given in the question. However, since the plaque was unveiled in 1949 and the march took place in the 21st century, I knew that the march must have taken place in 2011 or later. Therefore, I subtracted 1949 from 2011 to get 62. \n\nTo solve the problem better, the question could have provided the year of the memorial march, rather than just the fact that it took place on the anniversary of Kett's death.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn 1948, Alderman Fred Henderson, a former mayor of Norwich who had been imprisoned in the Castle for his part in the food riots of 1885, proposed a memorial to Kett. Originally hoping for a statue, he settled for a plaque on the walls of Norwich Castle engraved with his words and unveiled in 1949, 400 years after the rebellion. In the 21st century the death of Kett is still remembered by the people of Norwich. On 7 December 2011, the anniversary of his death, a memorial march by members of Norwich Occupy and Norwich Green Party took place and a wreath was laid by the gates of Norwich Castle.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after a plaque for Kett was unveiled was there a memorial march by members of Norwich Occupy and Norwich Green Party took place and a wreath was laid by the gates of Norwich Castle?",
