    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe most important component of the Paraguayan economy is the farming sector, which contributed 27% to GDP in 2006. The participation of commerce was 20.2%, and that of other services, including government, 38.4%. Industry's part  was about 20%. After years of economic crisis, between 1999 and 2002, the Paraguayan economy grew at between 2.9 and 4.1% per year from 2003 to 2006. For 2007, the estimated growth is about 6.4%. Inflation in 2007 reached 6.0%. Most enterprises are small, micro and individual ones, including subsistence jobs like street vendors. Only 4% of the Paraguayan labor force works in companies with more than 50 employees. In June 2007 external foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$2153 million, and the foreign official debt US$2154 million, close to parity. Fiscal surplus is provisionally reported as 0.5% of GDP in 2006 and 2007. Paraguay's economy  grew 5,8% in 2008, fastest growing sector being agriculture with 10,5% growth\n\nQuestion:\nHow many few percentages does industry contribute to the economy than other services?",
