    "problem_text": "Context:\nWeek 2 saw the Vikings make their regular season return to Mall of America Field with an interconference matchup against the Miami Dolphins, who they had not played since Week 11 of the 2006 season. Yet again, Minnesota conceded the first points of the game - on Miami's first offensive play of the game, Chad Henne threw a 46-yard pass to Brandon Marshall to get the Dolphins to the Minnesota 27-yard line; eight plays later, they had the ball in the endzone via a 5-yard pass from Henne to WR Brian Hartline. The 2nd quarter saw Brett Favre throw his second interception of the season - his first of four turnovers during the game. The second came midway through the 3rd quarter, when the 21-year veteran fumbled on a sack into his own endzone; the ball was recovered by Dolphins LB Koa Misi to give Miami a two-possession lead. A Minnesota fightback began soon after, but not before Favre threw another interception, picked off by CB Jason Allen at the Miami 2-yard line. However, on Miami's first play after the turnover, RB Ricky Williams fumbled during a tackle by LB E. J. Henderson; Henderson's brother Erin recovered the ball and made his way to the 1-yard line, giving the Vikings a 1st-and-goal opportunity. Favre failed to pick out TE Visanthe Shiancoe with the first play of the drive before allowing Adrian Peterson to barge through the line of scrimmage for the touchdown. A 13-play drive at the start of the 4th quarter got the Vikings into the Dolphins' redzone, but staunch defense forced them to settle for a 28-yard field goal. With just under six minutes left in the game, Minnesota DT Pat Williams forced another Miami fumble, recovered by E. J. Henderson 24 yards from the Miami endzone. A succession of rushing attempts from Adrian Peterson followed, getting the Vikings to within a yard of a go-ahead touchdown, but LB Karlos Dansby stopped him short of the line on 4th-and-goal. The Vikings had one more attempt to steal the win inside the final two minutes, but Favre's attempted pass to Shiancoe on 4th-and-6 from the Dolphins' 27 fell incomplete, allowing Henne to run the game out with a kneeldown, condemning the Vikings to two defeats in two.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the play drive?",
