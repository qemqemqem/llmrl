    "commentary_on_process": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. To solve the problem, I subtracted the starting year of the events (1950s) from the year of the 1979 European Parliament election. However, I did not take into account that the events continued into the 1980s. Therefore, a more accurate calculation would be to subtract the starting year (1950s) from the end of the events in the 1980s. This would give a duration of approximately 30 years. However, since the question asks for an approximate answer, 40 years is also a reasonable estimate. In the future, I will make sure to consider all relevant information and double-check my calculations to provide a more accurate answer.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, MK was in essence a political pressure group rather than a true political party, with members being able to join other political parties as well. It campaigned for the establishment of a Cornish University, a Cornish Industrial Board, and the repatriation of Heligoland Fresians whose land was used by the British government as a bombing range in the mid-1950s. It published numerous policy papers to support its positions. MK gained popularity in the 1960s, when it campaigned against 'overspill' housing developments in Cornwall to accommodate incomers from Greater London. In April 1967, Colin Murley was elected for MK onto Cornwall County Council for the seat of St Day and Lanner; he had stood on an anti-overspill platform. In 1968, the first edition of Cornish Nation was published; this is the party's magazine. However, by the 1970s the group developed into a more coherent and unified organisation. During this decade, MK began contesting Westminster parliamentary seats as well as local government ones. It held rallies in support of Cornwall's fishing industry and against regional unemployment and nuclear waste; in the 1980s, these rallies were aggravated by the policies of the incumbent Thatcher government. The party grew to become the leading champion for Cornish nationalism, superceding the Stannary Parliament in this respect. The party opposed the Common Market. MK contested the 1979 European Parliament election, winning 5.9% of the vote in the constituency of Cornwall and West Plymouth.\n\nQuestion:\nAbout how many years did these events span?",
