    "problem_text": "Context:\n After clinching the AFC north the previous week, the Bengals traveled to take on the New York Jets on Sunday Night Football. This would prove to be the final game to ever be played at Giants Stadium. The Bengals did not score in the first quarter, while the Jets had a 1-yard touchdown run by Thomas Jones to put the Jets up 7-0. The Bengals also failed to score in the 2nd quarter, while the Jets' offense had a very productive 2nd quarter, scoring 20 points. The Jets got a 20-yard field goal, to make the score 10-0 Jets. Brad Smith then had a 32-yard touchdown run to make the score 17-0. The Jets then got another touchdown run by Jerricho Cotchery. to make the score 24-0. The Jets finished the half with another field goal, to make the halftime score 27-0 Jets. The only score of the 3rd quarter came when J. Feely got a 40-yard field goal, to make the score 30-0. The Jets finished the game with another touchdown run by Thomas Jones, this time from 2 yards. The final score was Jets 37, Bengals 0. With the shutout loss, the Bengals finished the 2009 regular season with a record of 10-6.  By far, this is the only time in the Marvin Lewis era that the team has been shutout and suffered their first regular season shutout loss since 2001 when they lost 16-0 to the Ravens which was also a road game. In the wild card round of the playoffs, the Jets now had to travel to Paul Brown Stadium. The Bengals scored first when Carson Palmer threw an 11-yard TD pass to Laveranues Coles. In the second quarter, Jets RB Shonn Greene ran 39 yards for a TD, and Carson Palmer threw an interception that was returned for 20 yards. Mark Sanchez passed to Dustin Keller for a 45-yard TD, and the next scoring drive would come in the third quarter when Thomas Jones made a 9-yard TD run. Cedric Benson made a 47-yard TD in the fourth quarter, and the Jets responded with a 20-yard FG by Jay Feely. They halted any further attempts by the Bengals at a scoring drive, sacking Carson Palmer twice. The Jets ran out the clock for the last two minutes to end the game at 24-14.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points were the Jets leading by at halftime?",
