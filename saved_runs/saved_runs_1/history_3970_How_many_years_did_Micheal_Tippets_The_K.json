I also found that the composition did not use a classical guitar. Therefore, the answer to the problem is 5, as The Knot Garden did not use a classical guitar during the five years it was composed. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have searched for more sources to confirm the information about The Knot Garden's composition and the use of classical guitar.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nUntil the 1950s, the acoustic, nylon-stringed classical guitar was the only type of guitar favored by classical, or art music composers. In the 1950s a few Contemporary classical music composers began to use the electric guitar in their compositions. Examples of such works include Luciano Berios Nones (Berio) (1954) Karlheinz Stockhausens Gruppen (Stockhausen) (1955\u201357); Donald Erbs String Trio (1966), Morton Feldmans The Possibility of a New Work for Electric Guitar (1966); George Crumbs Songs, Drones, and Refrains of Death (1968); Hans Werner Henzes Versuch \u00fcber Schweine (1968); Francis Thornes Sonar Plexus (1968) and Liebesrock (1968\u201369), Michael Tippetts The Knot Garden (1965\u201370); Leonard Bernsteins Mass (Bernstein) (1971) and Slava! (1977); Louis Andriessens De Staat (1972\u201376); Helmut Lachenmanns Fassade, f\u00fcr grosses Orchester (1973, rev. 1987), Valery Gavrilin Anyuta (1982), Steve Reichs Electric Counterpoint (1987), Arvo P\u00e4rts Miserere (1989/92), Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1gs Grabstein f\u00fcr Stephan (1989), and countless works composed for the quintet of \u00c1stor Piazzolla. Alfred Schnittke also used electric guitar in several works, like the \"Requiem\", \"Concerto Grosso N\u00b02\" and \"Symphony N\u00b01\".\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did Micheal Tippets The Knot Garden use a classical guitar?",
