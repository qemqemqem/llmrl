    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Chiefs hosted the 3-0 Broncos in hopes of winning their first game of the season. The Chiefs' offense, averaging fewer than 11 points a game, turned early touchdown opportunities into short field goals. In its first two possessions, Denver's league-leading offense had a turnover, a sack and a shanked punt. Larry Johnson ran a career-long 65-yard run to the 21&#160;yard line on the game's second play. Kansas City had first-and-goal from the 9, but only managed a field goal. The field goal gave Kansas City their first lead in 22 quarters, since the team's lead against the Titans on December 16, 2007. With QB Damon Huard at the helm, the Chiefs' offense allowed no turnovers and scored more points in one game (33) than their first three games of the season combined (32). Denver's running defense was noticeably weak and allowed Chiefs RB Larry Johnson to run for 198&#160;yards. Johnson also tallied his first 2 touchdown game in over two years. Denver allowed four turnovers, which the Chiefs capitalized on three. Chiefs TE Tony Gonzalez scored one touchdown and finished the game within three yards shy of tying Shannon Sharpe's all-time receiving record (10,060). The win was Kansas City's first since a victory over Oakland on October 21, 2007. Johnson tallied his 29th career 100-yard rushing game and his fifth against Denver.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more touchdowns did Larry Johnson score when compared to Tony Gonzalez?",
