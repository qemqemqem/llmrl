The length of the shortest touchdown pass was not given, but we can calculate the difference between the lengths of the two touchdown passes by subtracting the length of the shortest touchdown pass from the length of the longest touchdown pass. Therefore, the answer is 70 yards.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to build off their divisional road win over the Chiefs, the Raiders flew to Ralph Wilson Stadium for a Week 3 duel with the Buffalo Bills. In the first quarter, Oakland got the early lead with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 23-yard and a 35-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Bills responded with RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 14-yard TD run. The Raiders would end the half with Janikowski kicking a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Raiders increased its lead with QB JaMarcus Russell getting a 1-yard TD run. However, in the fourth quarter, Buffalo started to rally as Lynch got a 3-yard TD run. Oakland would respond as Russell completed an 84-yard TD pass to WR Johnnie Lee Higgins, yet the Bills got near as QB Trent Edwards completed a 14-yard TD pass to WR Roscoe Parrish. Later, Buffalo completed its rally as kicker Rian Lindell nailed the game-winning 38-yard field goal. After the game, Chris Mortensen of ESPN and Jay Glazer of Fox Sports both erroneously reported that Lane Kiffin would be fired the following Monday; this turned out not to be the case, as Kiffin was coaching the team during Week 4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass than the shortest?",
