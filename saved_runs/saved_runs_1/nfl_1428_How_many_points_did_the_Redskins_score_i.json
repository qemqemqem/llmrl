    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off a win over the New Orleans Saints, the Cowboys went to FedExField to take on the Washington Redskins. In the first quarter, Tony Romo made a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roy Williams. In the second quarter, Marion Barber made a 3-yard touchdown run. The Cowboys ended the first half of the game holding Washington to no points. The Cowboys got a 23-yard field goal in the second half by their new kicker Shaun Suisham who had played for the Redskins prior to the game. The Redskins continued to be scoreless and ended the game being shut out. This was the first shutout victory over the Redskins since the Cowboys beat them 27-0 on December 14, 2003, and the first time they swept the Redskins since the 2004 season. With the victory, the Cowboys clinched a spot in the playoffs and improved from their final 9-7 record from the previous season. The win also closed the door on the 8-7 New York Giants, who had a 41-9 loss to the Carolina Panthers earlier that day. With the win, the Cowboys improved to 10-5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Redskins score in the game?",
