    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Industrial Workers of the World , whose members became known as \"Wobblies\", was founded in Chicago in 1905 by a group of about 30 labor radicals. Their most prominent leader was William \"Big Bill\" Haywood. The IWW pioneered creative tactics, and organized along the lines of industrial unionism rather than craft unionism; in fact, they went even further, pursuing the goal of \"One Big Union\" and the abolition of the wage system. Many, though not all, Wobblies favored anarcho-syndicalism. Much of the IWW's organizing took place in the West, and most of its early members were miners, lumbermen, cannery, and dock workers. In 1912 the IWW organized a strike of more than twenty thousand textile workers, and by 1917 the Agricultural Workers Organization  of the IWW claimed a hundred thousand itinerant farm workers in the heartland of North America. Eventually the concept of One Big Union spread from dock workers to maritime workers, and thus was communicated to many different parts of the world. Dedicated to workplace and economic democracy, the IWW allowed men and women as members, and organized workers of all races and nationalities, without regard to current employment status. At its peak it had 150,000 members , but it was fiercely repressed during, and especially after, World War I with many of its members killed, about 10,000 organizers imprisoned, and thousands more deported as foreign agitators. The IWW proved that unskilled workers could be organized. The IWW exists today, but its most significant impact was during its first two decades of existence.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after the \"Wobblies\" was founded did the IWW organize a strike of more than twenty thousand textile workers?",
