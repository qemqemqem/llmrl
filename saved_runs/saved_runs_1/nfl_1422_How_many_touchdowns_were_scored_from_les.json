    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their home win over the Seahawks, the Cowboys flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 9 NFC East duel with the Philadelphia Eagles with both teams fighting for the division lead.  Dallas would deliver the opening shot in the first quarter as running back Tashard Choice got a 2-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles would answer in the second quarter as kicker David Akers made a 45-yard and a 48-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys came right back with a 22-yard field goal from kicker Nick Folk. Philadelphia would take the lead in the third quarter as quarterback Donovan McNabb completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Celek.  Afterwards, Dallas would regain the lead in the fourth quarter as Folk booted a 33-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Tony Romo hooking up with wide receiver Miles Austin on a 49-yard touchdown pass.  The Eagles tried to rally as Akers nailed a 52-yard field goal, yet the 'Boys would run out the clock and grab the lead in the NFC East.  This win was only the Cowboys third win in the last eleven games at Philadelphia and avenged a 44-6 blowout loss at Lincoln Financial Field in the 2008 season finale.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were scored from less than 5 yards out?",
