    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Saints, the 49ers went home for a Week 5 interconference duel with the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, the Niners struck first as QB J.T. O'Sullivan completed a 16-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore.  The Patriots responded with QB Matt Cassel completing a 66-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss, yet San Francisco answered with O'Sullivan completing a 35-yard TD pass to WR Isaac Bruce.  In the second quarter, New England took the lead as kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 35-yard field goal, along with RB Kevin Faulk getting a 2-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Patriots increased their lead with Faulk getting another 2-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, New England added on to its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 40-yard field goal.  The Niners tried to come back as O'Sullivan completed a 5-yard TD pass to Bruce, but the Patriots pulled away with Gostkowski nailing a 49-yard field goal. During the halftime ceremony, the 49ers retired former QB Steve Young's #8 uniform.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Gostkowski score in the second half?",
