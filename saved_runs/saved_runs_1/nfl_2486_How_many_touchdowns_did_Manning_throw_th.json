Denver linebacker Von Miller had three sacks and forced two fumbles as the defense rattled Rivers. \"This is the best defensive team they've had since I've been playing them,\" said Rivers. The Chargers offense was shut out in the first half. Their first 12 possessions resulted in 10 punts and two turnovers. Rivers was 9-for-20 for 60 yards and an interception, and the running game had only 8 yards on 11 attempts. The Chargers first 9 points of the game were scored by the defense&#8212;an interception returned for a touchdown by Eric Weddle, and a safety by Shaun Phillips. Rivers threw for 198 of his 258 yards in the second half while throwing two touchdowns. Manning finished the game with 270 yards and three touchdown for Denver. Denver swept the season series against the Chargers, giving them the advantage in a tiebreaker with San Diego if needed. \"They're not losing four of six, I can guarantee you that\", Rivers said in conceding the division. He was part of the 2008 team that trailed Denver by three games with three remaining before winning the division as the Broncos collapsed.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Manning throw this game?",
