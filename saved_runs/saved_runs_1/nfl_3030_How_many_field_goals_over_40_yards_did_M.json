    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter the tough loss to the Chiefs, the Steelers returned home for a game against the Bengals in a much-hyped game due to Ben Roethlisberger being back from injury.  This was also game 1 of a 3-game home stand. In the first quarter, the Steelers took an early lead as Ben found Antonio Brown on a 1-yard pass for a 7-0 lead.  Later on, the Bengals came within 4 as Mike Nugent nailed a 44-yard field goal for a 7-3 game.  In the second quarter, the Bengals came within a point as Nugent nailed a 45-yard field goal for a 7-6 game at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Steelers increased their lead back to 4 as Chris Boswell nailed a 32-yard field goal to make it 10-6.  In the fourth quarter however, it was all Bengals as they took the lead when Andy Dalton found A. J. Green on a 9-yard pass for a 13-10 game followed up by Nugent nailing another 44-yard field goal for the final score of 16-10. With the loss, the Steelers fell to 4-4. Not only did they lose the game, but they also lost star running back Le'Veon Bell for the season due to a torn MCL. Despite the loss, the defense had yet another stellar outing by picking off Dalton twice and sacking him three times.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals over 40 yards did Mike Nugent have?",
