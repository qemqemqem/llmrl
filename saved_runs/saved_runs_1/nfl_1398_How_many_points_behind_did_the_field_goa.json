    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill looking to win the AFC North division after a disappointing Week 15 loss at San Diego, the Bengals went back home to Cincinnati to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.The first quarter was quiet, with neither team managing to get any points.Near the end of the first half, the Chiefs got a penalty for a bad snap before a punt. The ball went over the kicker's head, and resulted in a 1st and Goal for the Bengals. Carson Palmer then threw a touchdown pass to Chad Ochocinco, but the touchdown was reversed because he went out of bounds before he made the catch. The Bengals were then forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal by Shayne Graham, to make the score 3-0 Bengals. At the end of the first half, Ryan Succop kicked a 30-yard field goal for the chiefs, making the halftime score a tie, 3-3. The Bengals' offense did better at the beginning of the 3rd quarter, getting into the red zone in their first drive of the second half. Carson Palmer then threw a touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles, to put the Bengals on top, 10-3. Eight seconds into the 4th quarter, Tim Castille caught his first career touchdown, a 20-yard reception, to tie the score again, 10-10. The Bengals got yet another touchdown in the 4th quarter, and won the game 17-10. With the win, the Cincinnati Bengals clinched the AFC Northern Division Title and improved their regular season record to 10-5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points behind did the field goal by Shayne Graham put the Chiefs behind?",
