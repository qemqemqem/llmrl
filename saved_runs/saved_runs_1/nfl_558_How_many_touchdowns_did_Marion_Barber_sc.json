In the first quarter, Dallas took the early lead as they turned a first-play Philly fumble into RB Julius Jones' 2-yard TD run.  The Eagles would respond with RB Brian Westbrook getting a 3-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the 'Boys regained the lead with QB Tony Romo completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Tony Curtis.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys increased its lead with RB Marion Barber getting a 5-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, Dallas began to pull away as Romo completed a 45-yard TD pass to former Eagles WR Terrell Owens.  Philadelphia would reply with kicker David Akers getting a 36-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the 'Boys went back to work with Romo completing a 20-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas sealed the win with rookie kicker Nick Folk getting a 22-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Eagles' only response was QB Donovan McNabb completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Hank Baskett.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Marion Barber score?",
