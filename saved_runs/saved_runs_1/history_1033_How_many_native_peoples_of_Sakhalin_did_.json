Kublai was declared Khagan of the Mongol Empire in 1260  and established his capital at Khanbaliq  in 1264. Japan at the time was ruled by the Shikken  of the H\u014dj\u014d clan, who had intermarried with and wrested control from Minamoto no Yoriie, sh\u014dgun of the Kamakura shogunate, after his death in 1203. The inner circle of the H\u014dj\u014d clan had become so preeminent that they no longer consulted the council of the shogunate ), the Imperial Court of Kyoto, or their gokenin vassals, and made their decisions at private meetings in their residences ).
