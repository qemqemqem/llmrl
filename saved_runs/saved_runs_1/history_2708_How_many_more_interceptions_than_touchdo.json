    "problem_text": "Context:\nSmith finished the game with a Super Bowl record 204 rushing yards, and scored 2 touchdowns. His 58-yard touchdown run in the second quarter tied Tom Matte in Super Bowl III for the third-longest run in Super Bowl history, and Smiths 9.3 yard per carry average was the third-highest. Sanders caught 9 passes for 193 yards and 2 touchdowns, and returned 3 kickoffs for 46 yards. His 193 receiving yards and his 235 total offensive yards were both Super Bowl records, and his 80-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter also tied a Super Bowl record. Clark caught 3 passes for 55 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing once for 25 yards. Wilburn recorded 2 interceptions, while Walton had 2 sacks. Meanwhile, running back Gene Lang was the Broncos leading rusher, with only 38 yards on 5 carries. Elway finished the game with 14 out of 38 pass completions for 257 yards, 1 touchdown, and 3 interceptions. He was also Denvers second-leading rusher with 32 yards on 3 carries; this was the only Super Bowl in which Elway played without scoring a rushing touchdown. Jackson was Denvers top receiver with 4 catches for 76 yards.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more interceptions than touchdowns did Elway throw?",
