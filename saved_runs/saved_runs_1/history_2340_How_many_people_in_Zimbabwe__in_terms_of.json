To solve the problem, I would have needed to know the total population of Zimbabwe in 2012, which was not given in the context. However, if we assume that the total population of Zimbabwe in 2012 was the same as the total population in 2019 (14.6 million), then the percentage of people in Zimbabwe who were not part of the white population in 2012 would be approximately 99.78%. This is calculated by subtracting the number of white people (28,782) from the total population (14.6 million) and then dividing the result by the total population and multiplying by 100. \n\nTo solve the problem better, it would have been helpful to have the total population of Zimbabwe in 2012 explicitly stated in the context.

White Zimbabweans are mostly of British origin, but there are also Afrikaner, Greeks in Zimbabwe, Portuguese people, Franco-Mauritian and Dutch people communities. The white population dropped from a peak of around 278,000 or 4.3% of the population in 1975 to possibly 120,000 in 1999, and was estimated to be no more than 50,000 in 2002, and possibly much less. The 2012 census lists the total white population at 28,782 (roughly 0.22% of the population), one-tenth of its 1975 estimated size. Most emigration has been to the United Kingdom (between Zimbabweans in the United Kingdom Britons are of Rhodesian or Zimbabwean origin), South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Coloureds form 0.5% of the population, and various Asian people ethnic groups, mostly of Indian and Chinese origin, are also 0.5%.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many people in Zimbabwe, in terms of percentage, were not part of the White population as of 2012?",
