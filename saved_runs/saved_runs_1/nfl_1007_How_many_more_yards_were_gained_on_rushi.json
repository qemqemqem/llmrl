    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off the MNF divisional home win over the Eagles, the Cowboys flew to Lambeau Field for a Week 3 Sunday Night duel with the Green Bay Packers. Dallas had never won in Lambeau Field heading into the game, going 0-5 (although Green Bay did play several home games in Milwaukee where the Cowboys won a few times against the Packers). In the first quarter, Dallas got the first shot as kicker Nick Folk got a 25-yard field goal.  The Packers responded with kicker Mason Crosby getting a 36-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Green Bay took the lead with Crosby kicking a 38-yard field goal.  The 'Boys replied with rookie RB Felix Jones getting a 60-yard TD run, becoming the first player in franchise history to have a touchdown in each of his first three games with Dallas.  In the third quarter, the Packers tried to rally as Crosby got a 33-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys responded with RB Marion Barber getting a 2-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas managed to put the game out of reach as QB Tony Romo completed a 52-yard TD pass to WR Miles Austin.  Green Bay tried to rally as QB Aaron Rodgers got a 1-yard TD run, yet the Big D's defense held. With the win, not only did the Cowboys get a second-straight 3-0 start for the first time since 1976-77, but they also picked up their first-ever win at Lambeau Field.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more yards were gained on rushing touchdowns when compared to passing touchdowns?",
