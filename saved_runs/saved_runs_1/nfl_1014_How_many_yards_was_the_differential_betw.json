In the first quarter, the 'Boys trailed early as Redskins QB Jason Campbell completed a 2-yard TD pass to FB Mike Sellers.  In the second quarter, Dallas responded with RB Marion Barber getting a 2-yard TD run.  Washington would close out the half with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 41-yard field goal.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Cowboys took a fourth quarter lead as QB Tony Romo completed a 25-yard TD pass to rookie TE Martellus Bennett.  Afterwards, Dallas' defense kept the Redskins' offense from making any kind of a comeback.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the differential between the longest field goal and the longest touchdown?",
