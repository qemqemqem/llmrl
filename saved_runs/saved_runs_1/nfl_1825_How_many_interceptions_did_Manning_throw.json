    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the Super-bowl Champions the Cowboys played against the Super-bowl runners-up at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Cowboys commanded the first quarter when Tashard Choice got a 20-yard TD run, followed by kicker David Buehler nailing a 30-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Cowboys increased their lead as CB Orlando Scandrick returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown. The lead was narrowed when QB Peyton Manning made a 13-yard TD pass to WR Pierre Gar&#231;on, followed in the third quarter by Manning getting a 34-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne. The Cowboys extended their lead with Buehler hitting a 46-yard field goal, followed by Sean Lee returning an interception 31 yards for a touchdown. They trailed slightly as RB Javarris James got a 1-yard TD run, followed by Mat McBriar's punt getting blocked and returned 2 yards for a touchdown by Taj Smith. They replied to get the lead back as QB Jon Kitna completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten (With a successful 2-point conversion as Kitna passed to WR Roy E. Williams), but the game was tied when James got a 2-yard TD run. At overtime, Manning threw his fourth interception, (which totalled 11 interceptions in three consecutive games.) to LB Sean Lee, which soon converted into a successful 38-yard field goal attempt by Buehler, giving the Cowboys the win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many interceptions did Manning throw?",
