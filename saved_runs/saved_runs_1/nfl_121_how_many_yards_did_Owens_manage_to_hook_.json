In the first quarter, Dallas took an early lead with QB Tony Romo completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys increased its lead as on the very first play, OLB DeMarcus Ware returned an interception 41 yards for a touchdown.  However, the Falcons started to fight back with QB Michael Vick completing a 1-yard TD pass to FB Justin Griffith and a 9-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins.  Fortunately, the 'Boys struck back with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again with a 51-yard TD pass.  Yet again, Atlanta fought back with Vick completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Ashley Lelie.  In the third quarter, Dallas temporarily fell behind with Vick completing 5-yard TD pass to Griffith.  Afterwards, the Cowboys regained control with kicker Martin Gramatica's 48-yard field goal and RB Marion Barber 9-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Barber helped the Cowboys wrap the game up with a 3-yard TD run.  With the win, the 'Boys improved to 9-5 and put themselves in position to clinch a playoff berth following the day.Stats\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did Owens manage to hook?",
