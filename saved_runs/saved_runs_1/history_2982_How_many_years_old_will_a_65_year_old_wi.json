To solve the problem, I first identified the relevant information, which was that the basic old-age pension scheme covers individuals 65 years of age who earned below a certain amount set by presidential order. In 2010, that ceiling was 700,000 KRW for a single individual. However, individuals with a minimum of 10 years covered under the national pension scheme and who are 60 years of age are able to be covered under a reduced old-age pension scheme. \n\nTo find the age at which a 65-year-old with 10 years of pension coverage would retire with a basic pension, I should have subtracted 10 from 65 to get 55, which is the age at which they would have had to start contributing to the national pension scheme to be eligible for the reduced old-age pension scheme. Then, I should have added 10 years of coverage to 55 to get 65, which is the age at which they would retire with a basic pension. \n\nIn the future, I will make sure to double-check my calculations to avoid making mistakes like this.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nSouth Koreas old-age pension scheme covers individuals age 60 or older for the rest of their life as long as they have satisfied the minimum of 20 years of national pension coverage before hand. Individuals with a minimum of 10 years covered under the national pension scheme and who are 60 years of age are able to be covered by under a reduced old-age pension scheme. There also is an active old-age pension scheme that covers individuals age 60 to 65 engaged in activities yielding earned income. Individuals age of 55 and younger than 60 who are not engaged in activities yielding earned income are eligible to be covered under the early old-age pension scheme. Around 60% of all Korean elders, age 65 and over are entitled to a 5% benefit of their past average income at an average of 90,000 Korean won (KRW). Basic old-age pension schemes covered individuals 65 years of age who earned below an amount set by presidential order. In 2010, that ceiling was 700,00 KRW for a single individual and 1,120,000 for a couple, equivalent to around $600.00 and $960.00.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years old will a 65 year old with 10 years of pension coverage have to be to retire with a basic pension?",
