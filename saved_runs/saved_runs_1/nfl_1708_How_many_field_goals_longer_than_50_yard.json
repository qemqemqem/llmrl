    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Cardinals thirteenth game was an interconference duel with the Broncos. The Cardinals trailed early as Broncos kicker Steven Hauschka nailed a 32-yard field goal, but rallied to take the lead with kicker Jay Feely making a 36 and a 48-yard field goal, followed by his 5-yard TD run to the endzone, then he made a 55, 23 and a 49-yard field goal to put the Cardinals up 22-3. The lead was narrowed slightly as Hauchka got a 30-yard field goal, but the Cardinals increased their lead with RB Tim Hightower getting an 8-yard TD run. The Broncos tried to break down the lead as RB Knowshon Moreno got a 1-yard TD run, but the Cardinals pulled away with Hightower getting a 35-yard TD run, followed by DE Darnell Dockett recovering a fumble in the endzone for a touchdown. With the win, Arizona improved to 4-9, and got their first-ever win over the Broncos in the franchise's history, though they tied in 1973 and never played the Broncos between 1978 and 1988. Despite losing nine games on the year, the Cardinals are still playoff-eligible in the very weak NFC West.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals longer than 50 yards were scored?",
