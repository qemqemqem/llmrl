    "problem_text": "Context:\nLooking to stay in the division race, the Raiders returned to Oakland to take on a struggling Denver team. With a loss earlier in the day by the Chiefs, the Raiders controlled their own destiny to win the division. Following three-and-outs for each team on their first possession, a fight broke out between the teams as Denver cornerback Aqib Talib and Raider receiver Michael Crabtree threw punches at each other and were ejected from the game. Raider offensive lineman Gabe Jackson was also ejected for fighting. After the fight, both offenses struggled for the remainder of the first quarter. On the Raiders first possession of the second half, following the team's first interception on the year, the offense went 80 yards on eight plays capped off by a Derek Carr to Amari Cooper nine-yard touchdown pass to give the Raiders the 7-0 lead. The Raiders scored again on their next possession as Marshawn Lynch scored from one yard out to extend the lead to 14-0 as the first half came to a close. In the second half, the Raider offense continued its good play scoring on a 66-yard drive when Carr hit Jalen Richard for six-yard touchdown and a 21-0 lead. Shortly thereafter, Bronco starting quarterback Paxton Lynch was replaced by Trevor Siemian, but the Raider defense continued to keep the Broncos in check as the third quarter ended. Denver's offense managed a touchdown with four minutes in to the fourth quarter to narrow the lead to 21-7. The Raiders were turned away on their next possession and came away with no points as Giorgio Tavecchio missed a 35-yard field goal. Siemian led the Broncos on a 12 play, 12 minute, 75-yard drive, hitting Bennie Fowler on a 22-yard pass to bring the Broncos within seven with 2:44 remaining in the game. The Broncos chose to not attempt an onside kick and Carr made them pay, hitting Cordarrelle Patterson on a 54-yard pass to allow the Raiders to run out the clock and secure the 21-14 win. The win moved the Raiders to 5-6 on the season and put them within one game of the Chiefs for the division lead. The Raiders, who had fired defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr. earlier in the week, out-gained the Broncos 348-219 in the game. The Raider defense also intercepted a pass for the first time on the season as NaVorro Bowman intercepted a Lynch pass early in the second half to set up the Raiders first score of the game. Amari Cooper was forced to leave the game in the second quarter with a suspected concussion.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were missed by the Raiders in the game?",
