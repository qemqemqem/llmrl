    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game losing streak and keep any playoff hope alive, the Panthers went home for a Week 14 fight with the New York Giants.  For this game, QB Chris Weinke would be making his first start since 2002, as he stood in place for an injured Jake Delhomme (thumb injury). In the first quarter, the Panthers trailed as Giants kicker Jay Feely nailed a 32-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Carolina's troubles increased as QB Eli Manning completed a 28-yard TD to WR Plaxico Burress.  The Panthers would get on the board with Weinke completing a 36-yard TD pass to WR Drew Carter, while kicker John Kasay nailed a 37-yard field goal.  However, the G-Men continued to pound out some frustrations as Manning completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey.  In the third quarter, Carolina's struggles continued with Feely kicking a 29-yard field goal, while Manning completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR David Tyree.  In the fourth quarter, the only sort of comeback Carolina could muster was Kasay's 45-yard field goal.  Despite Weinke throwing for 423 yards (with his 61 attempts becoming the second highest of his career), he threw 3 interceptions.  With their third-straight loss, the Panthers fell to 6-7.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did did feely nail?",
