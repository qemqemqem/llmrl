    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Giants, the Redskins returned home for a Week 6 fight with the Tennessee Titans.  In the first quarter, Washington trailed early as Tennessee kicker Rob Bironas kicked a 32-yard field goal.  RB Clinton Portis got a 10-yard TD run to help the Redskins regain the lead.  In the second quarter, the Skins increased their lead with QB Mark Brunell completing a 24-yard TD pass to TE Chris Cooley.  However, the Titans regained the lead with Bironas nailing a 26-yard field goal and QB Vince Young completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Jones.  In the third quarter, the Redskins continued to dig themselves a huge hole, as RB Travis Henry got a 2-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Titans got a safety on a blocked punt that rolled out the back of the end zone.  In the fourth quarter, Washington tried valiantly to fight back, as Portis got a 4-yard TD run, but in the end, Bironas got a 30-yard field goal for Tennessee and a late interception by Free Safety Lamont Thompson killed any chance of a comeback.  With the loss, the Redskins fell to 2-4. Stats\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Bironas kick?",
