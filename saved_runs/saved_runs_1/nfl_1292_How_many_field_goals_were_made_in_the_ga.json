Therefore, there were a total of 5 field goals made in the game.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have taken notes while reading the article to keep track of the number of field goals made by each team and each kicker.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Titans kept their record perfect by edging the Packers 19-16 in OT. Rob Bironas and Mason Crosby each traded field goals early in the first half and the Titans had a 6-3 edge until Aaron Rodgers hooked up with Donald Driver for a touchdown. Then LenDale White helped drive the ball downfield with 50-yard run that set up Chris Johnson's TD run to make it 13-10. In the second half, the Packers were able to tie the game with two more Crosby field goals and force it into overtime when Bironas missed a potential game-winning field goal at the end of regulation. In overtime, Kerry Collins and Johnson helped move the ball down the field for a game-winning 47-yard field goal by Bironas, who made up for his mistake at the end of the 4th. With the win, the Titans ran their regular season winning streak to 11 games, continued their hottest start in franchise history, and remained the only unbeaten team in the league as they improved to 8-0.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were made in the game?",
