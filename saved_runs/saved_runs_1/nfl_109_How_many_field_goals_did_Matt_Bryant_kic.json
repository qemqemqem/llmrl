    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Browns played their final home game of the year in a Week 16 interconference fight with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first half, Cleveland trailed as Buccaneers' kicker Matt Bryant kicked a 23-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 24-yard field goal in the second quarter.  In the third quarter, Tampa Bay continued its pounding with RB Michael Pittman's 11-yard TD run (with the following PAT being blocked).  In the fourth quarter, the Buccaneers further increased their lead with OLB Derrick Brooks returning an interception 21 yards for a touchdown.  Afterward, the Browns got their only score of the game with CB Daven Holly returning a fumble 40 yards for a touchdown.  Then, the Buccaners wrapped up the game with Bryant kicking a 37-yard field goal.  With the loss, Cleveland fell to 4-11.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Matt Bryant kick?",
