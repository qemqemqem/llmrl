    "problem_text": "Context:\nTwo weeks after their last meeting, the Bears faced the Vikings again, this time in Minnesota. During pregame warmups, the Bears lost kicker Robbie Gould to a left calf sprain, and was replaced by punter Adam Podlesh, though Gould would eventually kick the Bears extra points and an onside kick. Like the previous meeting, the game was injury-laden for the Bears, having lost Brian Urlacher, Tim Jennings, Stephen Paea and Earl Bennett before the game, while Henry Melton, Shea McClellin, Craig Steltz and Sherrick McManis were lost during the game. On the game's first play from scrimmage, Adrian Peterson broke free for a 51-yard gain, and scored on a one-yard touchdown run a few plays later. On Chicago's first drive, Jay Cutler's pass intended for Alshon Jeffery was intercepted by Josh Robinson, who returned the pick to the five-yard line, setting up Peterson's second one-yard touchdown run. Peterson would end the game rushing for a Vikings-record 104 yards. The Bears would finally score on Cutler's 23-yard touchdown pass to Jeffery to end the first half. The Vikings, however, scored once again when rookie Harrison Smith intercepted Cutler and returned the pick 56-yards for a touchdown. Cutler would later be lost for the game due to a neck injury when he was hit by Everson Griffen, and was replaced by Jason Campbell, who threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall to bring the Bears seven points behind. Marshall caught ten passes for 160 yards in the game, and surpassed Marty Booker's 2002 franchise season reception record with 101. However, Gould's onside kick was recovered by Kyle Rudolph, ending the game with a Vikings victory, and snapping the Bears six-game winning streak in the rivalry. With the loss, the Bears dropped to 8-5. The loss is the sixth straight by the Bears in December, dating back to the 2011 season. The Bears also dropped behind the Packers in the NFC North after the latter defeated the Detroit Lions 27-20.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many defensive touchdowns were scored in the game?",
