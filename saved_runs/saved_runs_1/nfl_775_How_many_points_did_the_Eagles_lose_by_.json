    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Eagles lost 16-13 to the New York Giants. The Eagles, with Donovan McNabb back under center, scored on their opening drive with Brian Westbrook finding the end zone on an 18-yard pass from McNabb. The Giants scored an FG after having first-and-goal from the one-yard line. Another New York field goal just before halftime left the score 7-6. A fumble recovery gave Philadelphia the ball at the Giant eight-yard line, and David Akers kicked a short field goal. Later in the third quarter, Westbrook fumbled and Sam Madison recovered for New York. Eli Manning connected with Plaxico Burress for a 20-yard touchdown two plays later giving the Giants a 13-10 lead. A 41-yard pass to Burress set up another Lawrence Tynes field goal making it 16-10. Akers kicked a 39-yarder after a nearly eight-minute drive by the Eagles in the fourth quarter. On the Eagles' next drive, they crossed into Giant territory, but turned the ball over on downs. After a three-and-out, New York punter Jeff Feagles kicked the ball to the Eagles' 11-yard line with&#160;:51 to play and no timeouts. McNabb led the Eagles down the field, giving Akers a chance from 57 yards out. Akers hit the right upright and the FG was missed with 1 second remaining. Westbrook rushed for 116 and had a receiving touchdown, while Trent Cole had two sacks. Burress had 136 yards and one score. The home loss leaves the Eagles at 5-8.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Eagles lose by?",
