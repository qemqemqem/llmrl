    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Rams began their season at Qwest Field with a Week 1 divisional duel with their NFC West rival, the Seattle Seahawks. After a scoreless first quarter, St. Louis trailed in the second quarter as Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Carlson. The Rams appeared to have a game-tying touchdown after blocking a Seattle field goal by Seahawks kicker Olindo Mare late in the quarter. However, it was overturned because there were twelve Rams' players on the field, leading to a Seahawks 12-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Nate Burleson. In the third quarter, Seattle continued its dominance with Hasselbeck completing a 33-yard touchdown pass to Carlson, along with running back Julius Jones getting a 62-yard touchdown run. From there on out, the Seahawks' defense helped secure a shutout win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did the Seahawks have?",
