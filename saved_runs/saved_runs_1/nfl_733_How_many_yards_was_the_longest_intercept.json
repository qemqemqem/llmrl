I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking about an interception return, which was not mentioned in the given context. The correct answer is 108 yards, which is the length of the kickoff return by CB Ellis Hobbs for a touchdown. To solve the problem, I read through the context carefully and identified the scoring plays by both teams. I then looked for the longest play from scrimmage, which was the 51-yard touchdown pass from Tom Brady to Randy Moss. However, I missed the fact that the longest play in the game was actually the 108-yard kickoff return by Ellis Hobbs. To solve the problem better, I could have taken more time to carefully read and analyze the context, paying close attention to all of the scoring plays and their yardage.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Jets began their 2007 campaign at home for a Week 1 divisional match-up with the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, New York immediately trailed as QB Tom Brady completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Wes Welker for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Jets tied the game with QB Chad Pennington completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.  However, the Patriots retook the lead with Brady completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson. On the opening kickoff for the third quarter, New York trailed even more as CB Ellis Hobbs returned the kickoff an NFL record 108&#160;yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, New England continued his onslaught as Brady completed a 51-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss.  The Jets would get their last score of the game with Pennington & Coles hooking up with each other again on a 1-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots would take over for the rest of the game as kicker Stephen Gostkowski nailed a 22-yard field goal, while FB Heath Evans ended the game with a 1-yard TD run. With the loss, New York began its season at 0-1 while the Patriots began 1-0. On September 10, Patriots coach Bill Belichick was accused by the Jets of authorizing his staff to film the Jets' defensive signals from an on-field location, a violation of league rules. The Jets confiscated the video camera used by video assistant Matt Estrella to film the signals during the game and filed a complaint to the league office, detailing the accusations. On September 13, Belichick was officially fined $500,000, while the Patriots were also fined $250,000, and forfeited their first round draft pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. If the Patriots had missed the playoffs, they would have instead forfeited their second and third round selections in the 2008 draft. Goodell said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick is effectively the team's general manager as well as head coach, and exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick, but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run. Belichick later issued a statement in which he apologized for what he called a \"mistake\" in his interpretation of the rules. However, he denied ever using videotape to gain an advantage while a game was underway.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest interception return in the game?",
