In the first quarter, Carolina struck first by turning their opening drive (which lasted 11 minutes and 1 second) into a 3-yard TD run by RB DeShaun Foster. The Colts would respond with kicker Adam Vinatieri getting a 20-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Indianapolis took the lead with RB Joseph Addai getting a 2-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, Indianapolis increased its lead with QB Peyton Manning completing a 4-yard TD pass to Addai, along with a 59-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne. In the fourth quarter, the Colts sealed their win with Addai getting a 12-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards were the total of all the touchdown run ins?",
