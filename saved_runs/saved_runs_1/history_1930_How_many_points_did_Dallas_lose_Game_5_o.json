    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn the 2013\u201314 NBA season, the Spurs once again swept the Mavs in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on April 16, 2014 ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the 2014 NBA Playoffs, where the Mavs would be the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas managed to reach an 81-71 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 85-90. However, the Mavs managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113-92, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Gin\u00f3bili managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108-106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2-1 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93-89 and later Game 5 at home 109-103, giving them a 3-2 lead. Luckily, the Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111-113. The Spurs won game 7 119\u201396, eliminating the Mavericks in the first round.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did Dallas lose Game 5 of the NBA Playoffs in 2014 by?",
