    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Giants, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West duel with the Oakland Raiders on Monday Night Football. The Broncos jumped out to a 17-0 lead, with a two-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Eric Decker, a 53-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater and 12-yard touchdown pass from Manning to wide receiver Wes Welker, the latter of which occurred in the second quarter. The Raiders got on the scoreboard when quarterback Terrelle Pryor completed a 73-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Denarius Moore. The Broncos subsequently added to their lead, with Manning throwing a 13-yard touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas, followed by two field goals by Prater &#8212; a 41-yarder just before halftime and a 40-yarder midway through the third quarter. Following a Manning fumble, the Raiders narrowed the Broncos' lead, with Pryor tossing the football on a running play to running back Darren McFadden, and McFadden throwing a 16-yard touchdown pass to fullback Marcel Reece, however, the Broncos responded early in the fourth quarter, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. The Raiders scored a late touchdown, with McFadden rushing for a 1-yard touchdown, however, the Broncos recovered the ensuing onside kick, sealing the win. This was the 17th meeting on Monday Night Football between the Broncos and Raiders &#8212; tied for the most frequent pairing in Monday Night Football history with the Dallas Cowboys & Washington Redskins, who will meet for a 17th time in 2015.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were due to passes by Manning?",
