    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn January 13, 1981, owner Jack Kent Cooke signed the offensive coordinator of the San Diego Chargers, Joe Gibbs, as their head coach. Also during the off-season, the Redskins acquired Mark May, Russ Grimm, and Dexter Manley in the 1981 NFL Draft, all of whom became significant contributors to the team for the next few years. After starting the 1981 NFL season 0\u20135, the Redskins won eight out of their next 11 games and finished the season 8\u20138. Starting on September 21, 1982, the NFL faced a 57-day long players 1982 NFL strike, which reduced the 1982 NFL season from a 16-game schedule to a nine-game schedule. Because of the shortened season, the NFL adopted a special 16-team playoff tournament, in which eight teams from each conference were seeded 1\u20138 based on their regular season records. After the strike was settled, the Redskins dominated, winning six out of the seven remaining games to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976 NFL season.  In January 1983, during the second round of the 1982\u201383 NFL playoffs against the Minnesota Vikings, John Riggins rushed for a Redskins playoff record 185 yards, leading Washington to a 21\u20137 win. The game is perhaps best known for a moment when the stadium physically shook as a crowd chanted \"We Want Dallas!\", which later became a rallying cry of sorts for Redskin fans before games against the Cowboys. In the NFC Championship Game against them at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley knocked Cowboys quarterback Danny White out for the rest of the game and sent him into the locker room shortly before halftime. Later in the game, Redskins defensive tackle Darryl Grants interception which he returned for a 10-yard touchdown off one of Cowboys backup quarterback Gary Hogebooms passes which was tipped by Dexter Manley to score the decisive points. John Riggins rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns on 36 carries and the Redskins went on to defeat the Cowboys by a score of 31\u201317. The Redskins first Super Bowl win, and their first NFL Championship in 40 years, was in Super Bowl XVII, where the Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins 27\u201317.  Riggins provided the games signature play when, on 4th and inches, with the Redskins down 17\u201313, the coaches called \"70 Chip\", a play designed for short yardage. Riggins instead gained  by running through would-be tackler Don McNeal and getting the go-ahead touchdown. The Redskins ended up winning by a 27\u201317 score with John Riggins winning the Super Bowl MVP.\n\nQuestion:\nIn Super Bowl XVII, how many more points did the Redskins make than the Miami Dolphins?",
