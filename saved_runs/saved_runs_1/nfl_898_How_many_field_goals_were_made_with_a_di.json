    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off a home loss to the Bills (along with attending Sean Taylor's funeral in Florida), the Redskins played at home for their Week 13 Thursday night inter-conference game with the Chicago Bears. After a scoreless first quarter, the Redskins scored first when quarterback Todd Collins completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Todd Yoder for the only score of the second quarter. In the third quarter, Washington's fullback Mike Sellers scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Bears would reply with kicker Robbie Gould making a 30-yard field goal, and later quarterback Brian Griese completed a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian. In the fourth quarter, the Redskins responded with kicker Shaun Suisham kicking a 23-yard field goal. Later, Chicago made it closer as Gould kicked a 22-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Redskins increased their lead with Collins completing a 16-yard touchdown pass to running back Ladell Betts. The Bears would answer with Gould making a 21-yard field goal, but their onside kick failed, which preserved a Washington win. Starting quarterback Jason Campbell (10/16 for 100 yards) left the game in the second quarter with a dislocated left knee cap.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were made with a distance between 20 and 25 yards?",
