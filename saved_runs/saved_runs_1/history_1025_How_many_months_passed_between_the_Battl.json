    "problem_text": "Context:\nIeremia Movil\u0103 died in 1606 . In 1607 Stefan Potocki set his brother-in-law , Constantin Movil\u0103 , on the Moldavian throne. However, Stefan Potocki was one of the pro-Habsburg magnates and Gabriel Batory, the anti-Habsburg ruler of Transylvania, removed Constantin Movil\u0103 in 1611 . The Moldavian throne now fell to \u0218tefan II Tom\u0219a . A second intervention by Stefan Potocki  in 1612 was a complete failure. Potocki's 7,000 strong army was defeated on 19 July in the Battle of Sasowy R\u00f3g  by troops of Tom\u0219a and Khan Temir's Tatars of the Budjak Horde. Stefan Potocki and Constantin Movil\u0103 ended their lives in Ottoman captivity in Constantinople. A counter-raid of Tatars and Tom\u0219a on the Commonwealth was stopped by \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski without a fight, and an agreement between \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski and Tom\u0219a was signed in October 1612 . Tom\u0219a assured about his friendliness, that he will help to patch up conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the Commonwealth and pledged allegiance to the Polish king. In 1613, when Sigismund signed a de facto anti-Turkish defensive treaty with the Habsburgs, counting on their support for his restoration to the Swedish throne, Poland further moved into the enemy camp from the Ottoman point of view. Hetman Stanis\u0142aw \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski, with a show of force, induced Moldavians and Turks to compromise and signed an agreement in 1612 with \u0218tefan Tom\u0219a at Khotyn.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many months passed between the Battle of Sasowy R\u00f3g and the agreement between \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski and Tom\u0219a?",
