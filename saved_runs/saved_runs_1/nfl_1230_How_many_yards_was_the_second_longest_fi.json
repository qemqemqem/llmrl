In the first quarter, the Niners trailed early as Cardinals kicker Neil Rackers got a 25-yard field goal. San Francisco responded with RB Frank Gore getting a 41-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Arizona regained the lead with QB Kurt Warner completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald. San Francisco tied the game with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 39-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Cardinals began to fly away as Rackers nailed a 31-yard field goal, along with RB Tim Hightower getting a 2-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Niners tried to respond as Nedney got a 30-yard field goal. However, Arizona pulled away with Rackers' 30-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the second longest field goal?",
