Of those stating a choice, 47.71% described themselves as Christian, 17.71% as Hindu, 12.26% as Muslim and 10% as having irreligion. Of the population, 39.96% were in full-time employment and 7.86% in part-time employment - compared to a London average of 42.64% and 8.62%, respectively. Residents were predominantly owner-occupiers, with 23.17% owning their house outright, and a further 31.33% owning with a mortgage. 10.59% were in public housing, with a further 13.29% renting from a housing association, or other registered social landlord.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percent of people were not owning with a mortgage?",
