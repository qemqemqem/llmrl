    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn October 15, the Chiefs traveled to Heinz Field to battle the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers.  The Chiefs entered the game 2-2 for the season, while the Steelers were 1-3 with a three-game losing streak.  The game was broadcast on CBS 4:15&#160;p.m. Pittsburgh time. Trent Green would sit out for the fourth straight week.  Damon Huard would make his fourth consecutive start as he entered the game ranked second in the NFL in quarterback ratings,  while the Chiefs defense ranked in the top five in the NFL.  Larry Johnson recovered from his facemask tackle from Antrel Rolle and started as running back. Ben Roethlisberger threw his first touchdown of the season as the Chiefs defense gave up 372 total yards in the first half,  allowing 17 first downs.  Cornerback Ty Law made a costly error in the opening series by slipping on the turf, allowing Santonio Holmes to gain 50&#160;yards on the third play of the game.  Holmes would have scored if he had not slipped as well. The Chiefs managed one touchdown in the game, coming from Larry Johnson in the third quarter.  Following a 49-yard interception by safety Troy Polamalu, Larry Johnson stopped Polamalu by tackling him from his long hair.  Johnson was not penalized for pulling Polamalu down, but by pulling him back up by his hair (a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct). The Chiefs put in rookie quarterback Brodie Croyle in the final quarter, who managed an interception for a touchdown and a sack, as the Steelers ended the game with the 45-7 victory margin.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many losses did the Chiefs start the game with?",
