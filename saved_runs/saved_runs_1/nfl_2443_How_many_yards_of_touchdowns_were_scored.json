To correctly answer the question, I should have added up the yards gained on all scoring plays in the first half, including the field goal. \n\nHere is the corrected solution: \n\nThe total number of yards of touchdowns and field goals scored in the first half is the sum of the yards gained on each scoring play. \n\nFrom the table, we can see that there were four scoring plays in the first half: a 4-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Sanders, a 1-yard run by Brown, a 70-yard fumble return by Boley, and a 30-yard field goal by Suisham. \n\nTherefore, the total number of yards of touchdowns and field goals scored in the first half is 4 + 1 + 70 + 30 = 105 yards. \n\nTo solve this problem better, I should have read the question more carefully and made sure to include all scoring plays in my calculation.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nAt the time of this game, northern New Jersey (and, indeed, a vast majority of the BosWash area) was recovering from the widespread damage and power outages caused by Hurricane Sandy. Played just days after the storm made landfall on the east coast, the blackouts and flooding even affected the visiting Steelers' travel schedule, and the team would be forced to fly into the area on the morning of the contest as opposed to the usual day beforehand. Both teams traded possessions through the first quarter before Steelers' wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger three minutes into the second period. A Shaun Suisham extra point gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead. The hometown Giants answered, tying up the game with a 1-yard run by Andre Brown. Shortly after, with around five minutes remaining in the half, New York's Osi Umenyiora was able to knock the ball from Roethlisberger's hand as the quarterback was attempting a pass. Giants linebacker Michael Boley took full advantage of the turnover, scooping up the fumble and giving the Giants a 14-7 lead on a 70-yard touchdown return. The Steelers were able to put together a final drive of the half, and a 30-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham narrowed the Giants' lead to four points at the half. Seven minutes into the third quarter, Giants' kicker Lawrence Tynes extended the home team's lead by three via a 50-yard field goal. With a minute to go in the period, Tynes would successfully convert a 23-yard attempt and give the Giants a ten-point lead with a quarter to play. A 51-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Mike Wallace would cut into the Giants' lead less than a minute into the fourth. New York would fail to accumulate any further points in the contest and, despite a botched fake field goal attempt by the Steelers, a 1-yard touchdown run by Pittsburgh back Isaac Redman gave the Steelers the lead and, eventually, the win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards of touchdowns were scored in the first half?",
