    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn week thirteen, the Bears visited the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome to play the Vikings, whom the Bears trailed 50-53-2 in the all-time series. Josh McCown was given the start for the third straight week, with an expectation that Jay Cutler would return the following week. McCown entered the game having a 65.5 completion percentage for 1,106 yards, seven touchdowns, an interception, and a 100.8 passer rating. As a result, McCown had an advantage over the Vikings' pass defense, which ranked 29th in the league with 282 passing yards allowed, while also allowing quarterbacks to record a 65 completion percentage, 40 attempts per game, and a 97.7 passer rating. Also, the Vikings allowed 31.5 points per game, the worst in the NFL, while recording only 14 turnovers. However, the Bears' defense was a weakness, ranking last in rushing yards allowed per game (145.2), total yards (1,597) and first-downs allowed (89); the defense was 31st in the NFL in yards per carry (4.9), first-down percentage (27.1) and 20-plus yard runs (12). Additionally, the defense allowed running backs in the previous five games to rush for 999 yards, average 5.8 yards per carry, and 197 yards per game. Adrian Peterson ran for an average of 108 yards per game in his career against the Bears, including 120.6 in the last three meetings between the two. Minnesota's rushing game also ran for a year-best 232 yards in the previous week. Cutler, Lance Briggs, Major Wright, Anthony Walters, James Brown, Jonathan Scott, and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the Bears. In the first quarter, McCown had a pass intercepted by Chad Greenway, but an offsides penalty on Robert Blanton nullified the play; the drive would end with the only score of the first quarter via Robbie Gould's 30-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Cordarrelle Patterson's 33-yard touchdown run gave the Vikings the lead; Gould would subsequently kick a 40-yard field goal. Before the half ended, Christian Ponder suffered from symptoms of a concussion and left. On the Bears' first drive of the second half, McCown threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. After the Vikings responded with Blair Walsh's 32-yard field goal, Jeffery caught a 46-yard touchdown pass over Viking cornerback Chris Cook to give Chicago the lead 20-10; Cook would eventually be ejected from the game for shoving side judge Laird Hayes. On Minnesota's first possession of the final quarter, Matt Cassel threw an eight-yard touchdown to Greg Jennings, and on Chicago's next drive, McCown's flip pass for Kyle Long was deflected and stripped by Audie Cole, with Marvin Mitchell recovering. Despite starting the drive in the Bears' red zone and reaching the six-yard line, Cassel's pass for Rhett Ellison was tipped and intercepted by Khaseem Greene. After the Bears punted, Cassel fumbled on the first play, but recovered. Afterwards, the Vikings drove from their own six-yard line to the Bears' 12, where Walsh tied the game with a 30-yard field goal, making the score 20-20. On the final play of regulation, Gould's attempted 66-yard field goal fell short. In overtime, the Bears' opening drive ended after McCown was sacked by Jared Allen and fumbled, with Jermon Bushrod recovering, prompting the Bears to punt. On the Vikings' first drive of the period, Walsh's 39-yard field goal was overruled by Ellison's facemasking penalty; Walsh would miss the eventual 57-yarder. The Bears would reach the Vikings' 29-yard line, and on second down, Gould missed the 47-yard kick wide right. The Vikings would reach Chicago's 16-yard line, allowing Walsh to kick the game-winning 34-yard field goal. Marc Trestman received criticism for calling Gould to attempt the 47-yard field goal on second down, with the Chicago Sun-Times calling the choice \"an indefensible case of playing scared.\" Trestman responded by stating he did not want to lose a fumble or suffer a penalty. Jeffery set the team record for the most receiving yards in one game with 249, surpassing his previous record set against the Saints in week 5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest field goal?",
