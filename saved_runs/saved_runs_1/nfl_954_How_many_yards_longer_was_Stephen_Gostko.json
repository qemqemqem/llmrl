    "problem_text": "Context:\n Trying to snap their two-game losing streak, the Bills wrapped up their three-straight divisional games in Gillette Stadium with a Week 10 AFC East duel with the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Patriots QB Matt Cassel got a 13-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, New England increased their lead as kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 32-yard field goal.  The Bills closed out the half with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 25-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Patriots answered with Gostkowski nailing a 37-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England pulled away with RB BenJarvus Green-Ellis getting a 1-yard TD run.  Buffalo ended the game with QB Trent Edwards completing a 14-yard TD pass to rookie WR James Hardy.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Stephen Gostkowski's second field goal compared to his first?",
