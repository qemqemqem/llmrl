In the first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Packers RB Ryan Grant completed a 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Rams tied the game with QB Marc Bulger completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt.  In the second quarter, St. Louis trailed again as QB Brett Favre completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Donald Lee.  The Rams would tie again as RB Steven Jackson getting a 46-yard TD run.  Green Bay would end the half with kicker Mason Crosby getting a 44-yard field goal. In the third quarter, St. Louis began to trail big as Crosby kicked a 50-yard field goal, along with Favre completing a 44-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings.  In the fourth quarter, the Packers sealed the win as Crosby nailed a 25-yard and a 46-yard field goal. With the loss, the Rams fell to 3-11.  With the Niners' win over the Bengals on Saturday Night, the Rams now drop back down to last in the NFC West.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest fourth quarter field goal?",
