To solve the problem, I looked at the information provided and identified that England beat Ireland 4-0 on 14 February 1903, which was one of the games played at Molineux. However, upon reviewing the information again, I realized that England scored five goals in the 5-2 defeat of Denmark national football team in a 1958 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 5 December 1956, which was the largest number of goals scored by England in any of the games played at Molineux. To solve the problem better, I could have reviewed the information more carefully and double-checked my answer before submitting it.",
