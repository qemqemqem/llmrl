To calculate the percentage difference in per capita GDP growth between the 1970s and the 1960s, we need to subtract the per capita GDP growth rate in the 1960s from the per capita GDP growth rate in the 1970s, divide the result by the per capita GDP growth rate in the 1960s, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage difference. \n\nSo, the calculation would be: \n\n((1.5 - 1.4) / 1.4) x 100 = 7.14%\n\nTherefore, the per capita GDP growth rate in the 1970s was 7.14% higher than it was in the 1960s. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I should have carefully read and understood the question before attempting to solve it.",

This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the formers annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s\u201418 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percent higher was the per capita GDP in the 1970s than it was in the 1960s?",
