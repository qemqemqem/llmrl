    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Lions the Packers flew to FedExField for an NFC duel with the Redskins. In the first quarter the Packers took the lead as QB Aaron Rodgers completed a 5-yard TD pass to TE Donald Lee. This was followed in the 2nd quarter by kicker Mason Crosby hitting a 52-yard field goal. The Redskins replied with kicker Graham Gano getting a 26-yard field goal. Then in the third quarter Crosby made a 36-yard field goal to put the Packers up 13-3. The Redskins rallied to tie the game with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 48-yard TD pass to WR Anthony Armstrong, followed by Gano making a 45 yard-field goal. At overtime, the decision was made when Gano successfully put away a 33-yard field goal to give the Packers their second loss of this season.  Donavan McNabb would finish the game with 357 passing yards and run his career record against Green Bay to 6 wins and 1 loss.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many is the difference in the yards of the TD pass to Lee and the yards of the third field goal made by Gano?",
