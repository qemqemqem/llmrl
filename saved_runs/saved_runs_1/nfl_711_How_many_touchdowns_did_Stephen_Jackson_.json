    "problem_text": "Context:\n Coming off a 41-24 victory over the Jaguars, the Saints stayed home to face the winless St. Louis Rams. The Saints started the game with an impressive opening drive that culminated in a 7-yard burst by Reggie Bush to give the Saints an early 7-0 lead. However, Rams running back Stephen Jackson answered with a 1-yard run of his own to tie the game toward the end of the 1st quarter. Midway through the 2nd quarter, tight end Randy McMichael gave the Rams a 14-7 lead on a 2-yard pass from Jackson. Jeff Wilkins made it a two-score game with a 49-yard field goal three minutes later. The Saints went to the locker room trailing 17-7. In the 2nd half, Wilkins kicked his 2nd field goal of the game, a 21-yard attempt, to increase the  lead to 13. Toward the end of the 3rd, Isaac Bruce caught a 9-yard pass by Marc Bulger to make it a 27-7 lead, putting the Saints in danger of losing their first game since early October. Drew Bennett added to the St. Louis lead by catching a three-yard pass by Bulger to give Bulger his second touchdown of the game, and to give St. Louis a surprising 34-7 lead. Drew Brees and Billy Miller hooked up for a 1-yard pass with 11:36 left to cut the lead to 34-13. The Saints then converted a two-point conversion on a Bush run, to make it 34-15. Aaron Stecker then scored on a two-yard run with 4:42 remaining to cut it to 34-21. This time, however, they failed on the two-point conversion. With 1:55 left, a Wilkins field goal made it 37-21. The Saints scored another touchdown with 37 seconds left, but their attempt to recover the ball from an onside kick failed, and the Rams held on to defeat the Saints 37-29, giving the Rams their first victory in 2007 and dropping the Saints to 4-5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Stephen Jackson score in the first quarter?",
