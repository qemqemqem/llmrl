    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Chiefs made their regular season debut at home against the Cowboys. They would score first as Jamaal Charles caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Alex Smith for a 7-0 lead. The Boys got on the board as Dan Bailey kicked a 51-yard field goal for a 7-3 game followed up by Tony Romo and Dez Bryant hooking up on a 2-yard pass for a 10-7 lead. With the 2nd quarter being scoreless, the Boys gradually held on to the lead. In the 3rd quarter, Bailey nailed a 30-yard field goal to increase their lead 13-7. However, the Chiefs retook the lead as Smith found Dwayne Bowe on a 12-yard pass making the score 14-13. In the 4th quarter, the Chiefs increased their lead as Ryan Succop nailed a 40-yard field goal for a 17-13 lead. The Boys then tried to rally late, but came up a point short when Bailey kicked a 53-yard field goal as the Chiefs won the game 17-16 sending them to their first 2-0 start since 2010.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
