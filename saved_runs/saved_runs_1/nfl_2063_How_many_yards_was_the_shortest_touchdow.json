I misunderstood the question and provided the length of the touchdown scored by the 49ers instead of the shortest touchdown of the game. To find the shortest touchdown of the game, I should have compared the length of all the touchdowns scored by both teams and identified the one with the smallest yardage. The correct answer is that the shortest touchdown of the game was 3 yards, which was scored by Thomas Jones of the Chiefs. In the future, I will make sure to read the question more carefully and double-check my calculations to avoid making similar mistakes.",

In the 2nd quarter, the 49ers trailed early as QB Matt Cassel completed a 31-yard TD pass to WR Dexter McCluster. The 49ers replied with kicker Joe Nedney hitting a 51-yard field goal. The 49ers fell further behind when Chiefs' kicker Ryan Succop hit a 32-yard field goal and then in the third quarter when Cassel found WR Dwayne Bowe and TE Tony Moeaki on 45 and 18-yard TD passes, respectively. RB Thomas Jones followed these scores with a 3-yard TD run. The 49ers narrowed the score when QB Alex Smith made a 12-yard TD pass to WR Josh Morgan.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest touchdown of the game?",
