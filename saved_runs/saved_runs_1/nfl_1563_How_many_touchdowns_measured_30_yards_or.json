    "problem_text": "Context:\n The Jets began their season at Reliant Stadium for a Week 1 showdown with the Houston Texans.  New York took off in the first quarter as kicker Jay Feely nailed a 24-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Jets would increase their lead as rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez completed his first career touchdown pass as he connected with wide receiver Chansi Stuckey on a 30-yard pass.  In the third quarter, New York continued their run as running back Thomas Jones got a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as safety Dominique Barber returned a fumble 48 yards for a touchdown, but the Jets would end the game with Jones getting a 38-yard touchdown run. With the win, not only did New York begin their season at 1-0, but Sanchez (18-of-31, 272 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT) would become the 1st Jets rookie QB since Richard Todd in 1976 to win a game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns measured 30-yards or more?",
