To find the difference between Nick Folk's longest and shortest field goals, we can subtract the distance of his shortest field goal (38 yards) from the distance of his longest field goal (46 yards):\n\n46 yards - 38 yards = 8 yards\n\nHowever, the correct answer is 12 yards, not 8 yards. This is because Nick Folk also made a 34-yard field goal in the game, which is shorter than his shortest field goal of 38 yards. Therefore, to find the difference between his longest and shortest field goals, we need to subtract 34 yards from 46 yards:\n\n46 yards - 34 yards = 12 yards\n\nIn hindsight, I could have solved this problem better by carefully reviewing all the information provided in the context before attempting to solve the problem.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye week, the Cowboys went home for a Week 7 duel with the Atlanta Falcons.  Dallas would trail in the first quarter as Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan found wide receiver Roddy White on a 4-yard touchdown pass.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys came out shooting as kicker Nick Folk made a 38-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Tony Romo completing a 59-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Miles Austin and a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Patrick Crayton. Atlanta tried to catch up in the third quarter with running back Michael Turner's 2-yard touchdown run, yet Dallas answered with Romo finding Austin again on a 22-yard touchdown pass.  The Cowboys would increase their lead in the fourth quarter with Folk nailing a 46-yard field goal and Crayton returning a punt 73 yards for a touchdown.  The Falcons tried to come back with Ryan's 30-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Weems, yet Dallas closed out the game with Folk's 34-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Nick Folk's longest field goal than his shortest?",
