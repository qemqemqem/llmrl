The album sold approximately 284,000 copies in its first week and 1,322,000 copies in the following week. To find out how many more copies the album sold in the following week than the first week, I subtracted the first week's sales from the following week's sales: \n\n1,322,000 - 284,000 = 1,038,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1,038,000.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have used a calculator to perform the subtraction more accurately and quickly. Additionally, I could have double-checked my calculations to ensure that I did not make any errors.",

The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling approximately 284,000 copies in its first week, marking the first time an album had topped the charts with such an abbreviated sales week.

The album sold 381,000 copies in its fifth week and topped the Billboard 200 for a fifth and final consecutive week. It has gone on to sell over 10,000,000 copies. On March 7, 2011, the album was certified 10x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, making it Eminems second album to receive a RIAA certification in the United States.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more copies of the album did The Eminen Show sell in the following than the first week?",
