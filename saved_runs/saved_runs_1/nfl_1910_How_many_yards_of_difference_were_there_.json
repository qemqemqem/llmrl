In the first quarter the Chiefs trailed early as kicker Josh Brown nailed a 37 and a 52-yard field goal. They took the lead with QB Matt Cassel throwing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Leonard Pope, which was extended with RB Jamaal Charles getting a 2-yard TD run, followed by kicker Ryan Succop making a 53 and a 38-yard field goal. The lead was narrowed when RB Steven Jackson got a 5-yard TD run, but the Chiefs pulled away with RB Thomas Jones getting a 2-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards of difference were there between Josh Brown's first two field goals?",
