To find the difference between the length of Jason Hanson's longest and shortest field goals, we need to subtract the length of his shortest field goal (30 yards) from the length of his longest field goal (48 yards). Therefore, the answer is 18 yards. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have paid closer attention to the details in the given information and the keywords in the question.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to increase their current winning streak the Rams flew to Ford Field for an NFC duel with the Lions. The Rams trailed early with kicker Jason Hanson making a 30-yard field goal, but the Rams replied with kicker Josh Brown making a 28-yard field goal. In the second quarter the Rams struggled as Hanson's kick was returned 105&#160;yards to the endzone by WR Stefan Logan, followed by QB Shaun Hill making a 1-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. The Rams tried to cut the lead with Brown nailing another 28-yard field goal, but they continued to struggle when Hill found TE Brandon Pettigrew on a 3-yard TD pass and then in the 3rd quarter he found WR Nate Burleson on a 26-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter the Rams had more problems when they gave up a 48 and a 47-yard field goal by Hanson and an interception by DB Alphonso Smith in which he returned 42&#160;yards to the endzone for a touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Jason Hanson's longest field goal from his shortest?",
