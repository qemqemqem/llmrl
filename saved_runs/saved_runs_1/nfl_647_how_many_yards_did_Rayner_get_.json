    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the Jaguars, the Chiefs stayed at home for their Week 6 game against the Cincinnati Bengals.  In the first quarter, Kansas City drew first blood with kicker Dave Rayner getting a 32-yard field goal.  The Bengals would take the lead with QB Carson Palmer completing a 42-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  Fortunately, the Chiefs retook the lead with QB Damon Huard completing a 3-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  With the touchdown, Gonzalez surpassed Shannon Sharpe's record for the most TD catches by a tight end with his 63rd career touchdown reception. In the second quarter, Kansas City increased its lead with RB Larry Johnson getting an 8-yard TD run (which was the first rushing TD by a Chiefs RB this year), along with Rayner ending the half with a 20-yard field goal. At halftime, former Chiefs safety Albert Lewis was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame. After a scoreless third quarter, Cincinnati began to fight back as kicker Shayne Graham got a 33-yard field goal. After Kansas City increased its lead with Huard hooking up with Gonzalez again on a 26-yard TD pass, the Bengals nearly managed to tie the game with Palmer hooking up with Houshmandzadeh again on a 30-yard TD pass, along with Graham kicking a 36-yard field goal. K.C. managed to recover the onside kick and get the victory.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did Rayner get?",
