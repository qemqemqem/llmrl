    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter their win over the Panthers the Seahawks flew to Candlestick Park for an NFC West rivalry match against the 49ers. The Seahawks trailed early with QB Alex Smith completing a 42-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis, but they replied with QB Matt Hasselbeck throwing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Ruvell Martin. They fell further behind when kicker Jeff Reed hit a 33 and a 44-yard field goal, followed by Smith completing a 15 and a 62-yard TD pass to Josh Morgan and Brian Westbrook respectively. This was followed by Reed making a 22-yard field goal, and in the third quarter with FS Dashon Goldson returning an interception 39 yards for a touchdown. After that, Reed nailed a 36-yard field goal to put the 49ers up 40-7. The Seahawks tried to cut the lead down but only came away with RB Leon Washington returning the kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown, and in the 4th quarter with QB Matt Hasselbeck getting a 2-yard TD pass to WR Deon Butler.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards did Alex Smith throw for touchdowns?",
