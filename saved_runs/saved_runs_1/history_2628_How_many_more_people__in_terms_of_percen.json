Then, I added the percentage of positive views in Egypt and Pakistan, which is 14%. Finally, I subtracted the sum of positive views in Egypt and Pakistan from the percentage of positive views in the Philippines, which gave me 78%. However, the question asked for the percentage difference, not the percentage of positive views in each country. So, I subtracted the percentage of positive views in Egypt and Pakistan from the percentage of positive views in the Philippines, which gave me 92% - 24% = 68%. To solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully and directly calculated the percentage difference between the positive views in the Philippines and the combined positive views in Egypt and Pakistan.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nA global survey done by Pewglobal indicated that at (as of 2014) least 33 surveyed countries have a positive view (50% or above) of the United States. With the top ten most positive countries being Philippines (92%), Israel (84%), South Korea (82%), Kenya (80%), El Salvador (80%), Italy (78%), Ghana (77%), Vietnam (76%), Bangladesh (76%), and Tanzania (75%). While 10 surveyed countries have the most negative view (Below 50%) of the United States. With the countries being Egypt (10%), Jordan (12%), Pakistan (14%), Turkey (19%), Russia (23%), Palestinian Territories (30%), Greece (34%), Argentina (36%), Lebanon (41%), Tunisia (42%). Americans own view of the United States was viewed at 84%. International opinion about the US has often changed with different executive administrations. For example in 2009, the French public favored the United States when President Barack Obama (75% favorable) replaced President George W. Bush (42%). After President Donald Trump took the helm in 2017, French public opinion about the US fell from 63% to 46%. These trends were also seen in other European countries.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more people, in terms of percentage, viewed the United States positively in the Philippines compared to Egypt and Pakistan combined?",
