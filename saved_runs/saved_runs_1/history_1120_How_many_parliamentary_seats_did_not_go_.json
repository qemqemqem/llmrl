    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn the 2010 parliamentary elections, the ruling New Azerbaijan Party strengthened its grasp on the legislature, securing a majority of 73 out of 125 seats. The other seats went to nominally independent, government-leaning candidates, and to \"soft opposition\" parties. The two major opposition parties  lost their previous eight seats, thus resulting in an opposition-free Parliament. The Central Election Commission said turnout was 50.1%, out of a total 4.9 million people eligible to vote. Opposition leaders suggested the low turnout was due to candidate disqualifications by the CEC, and consequent discouragements to vote after their choice of candidate was excluded. The United States declared that the elections \"did not meet international standards\", while the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, EU and Council of Europe highlighted some positive aspects, while stating that \"the conduct of the elections did not represent significant progress in the process of the country's democratic development\". 2015 Parliamentary elections resulted in 72 seats won by ruling party. Currently Parliament consists of 15 parliamentary committees:\n\nQuestion:\nHow many parliamentary seats did not go the New Azerbaijan Party?",
