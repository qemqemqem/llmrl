    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their road win over the Texans, the Ravens flew to Giants Stadium for a Week 11 interconference duel with the defending Super Bowl champions, the New York Giants.  In the first quarter, Baltimore trailed early as Giants RB Brandon Jacobs got back-to-back 1-yard TD runs (with a failed PAT on the latter).  In the second quarter, the Ravens continued to struggle as quarterback Eli Manning completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Darcy Johnson.  Baltimore closed out the half with kicker Matt Stover getting a 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Ravens tried to rally as rookie quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 10-yard TD pass to FB Le'Ron McClain.  However, New York answered with CB Aaron Ross returning an interception 50 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants closed out the game as kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 19-yard field goal. The Ravens' top-ranked rushing defense gave up 207 yards, which is the most since October 1997 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Brandon Jacobs rush for?",
