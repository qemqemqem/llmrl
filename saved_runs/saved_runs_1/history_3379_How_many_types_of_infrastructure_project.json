To solve the problem, I would have gone through the context and identified the types of infrastructure projects mentioned. Then, I would have determined the number of projects constructed for each type and compared it to the number 100 to identify the types of infrastructure projects that had less than 100 constructed. However, I missed the fact that the context mentions two types of infrastructure projects that had less than 100 constructed: ski jumps (65) and outdoor theaters (138). To solve the problem better, I could have paid closer attention to the numbers mentioned in the context and double-checked my answer before submitting it.",

Most of these are still in use today. The amount of infrastructure projects of the WPA included 40,000 new and 85,000 improved buildings. These new buildings included 5,900 new schools; 9,300 new auditoriums, gyms, and recreational buildings; 1,000 new libraries; 7,000 new dormitories; and 900 new armories. In addition, infrastructure projects included 2,302 stadiums, grandstands, and bleachers; 52 fairgrounds and rodeo grounds; 1,686 parks covering 75,152 acres; 3,185 playgrounds; 3,026 athletic fields; 805 swimming pools; 1,817 handball courts; 10,070 tennis courts; 2,261 horseshoe pits; 1,101 ice-skating areas; 138 outdoor theatres; 254 golf courses; and 65 ski jumps. Total expenditures on WPA projects through June 1941 totaled approximately $11.4 billion\u2014the equivalent of $}} today. Over $4 billion was spent on highway, road, and street projects; more than $1 billion on public buildings, including the iconic Dock Street Theatre in Charleston, the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, and Timberline Lodge in Oregons Mount Hood National Forest.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many types of infrastructure projects had less than 100 constructed?",
