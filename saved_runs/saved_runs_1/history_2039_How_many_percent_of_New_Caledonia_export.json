Therefore, the remaining percentage of exports that were not mineral products and alloys can be calculated by subtracting 96.3% from 100%. This gives us 3.7% as the percentage of New Caledonia's exports that were not mineral products and alloys. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have used a table or diagram to organize the given information more clearly.
