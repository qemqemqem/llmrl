    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Redskins began their 2008 campaign on the road against their NFC East rival and defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants. In this  annual kickoff game, coach Jim Zorn made his official NFL head coaching debut.  In the first quarter, Washington trailed early as Giants QB Eli Manning closed out their opening drive with a 1-yard TD run.  Later in the quarter, New York added onto their lead when John Carney kicked a 24-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the 'Skins continued to trail as Carney kicked two more field goals of 25 and 47 yards. Near the end of the half, Washington finally got on the board as QB Jason Campbell completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss.  However, the second half was an all-out defensive struggle as New York held on for the win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Carney kick in the first quarter?",
