    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn November 5, the Chiefs traveled to the Edward Jones Dome to battle their intrastate and interleague rivals, the St. Louis Rams.  The Chiefs were defending the Missouri Governor's Cup, in which both teams competed in the pre-season.  The game was broadcast on CBS at noon St. Louis time. Chiefs' running back Priest Holmes would meet with a neurosurgeon about his October 30 neck injury, suffered against the Chargers' Shawne Merriman.  Holmes must practice by November 7 to be eligible to remain in the season.  Trent Green suited up for the game against the Rams, but was listed as the third quarterback behind starter Damon Huard and rookie Brodie Croyle.  Herm Edwards said there was no chance Green would play against the Rams, but could be back by week 10. Damon Huard threw a 43-yard pass to Samie Parker which put the Chiefs in the red zone at the 3-yard line.  Huard continued the drive with a 3-yard pass to Tony Gonzalez, his 58th career touchdown and the Chiefs' all-time record breaker for Tight ends.  The Chiefs were leading with two and a half minutes into the game.  Kansas City again used Larry Johnson's speed to their advantage as Johnson broke a 16-yard dash, setting up a field goal by Lawrence Tynes on fourth and one.  An offensive battle ensued between the two teams before the half, as Tony Gonzalez scored his 59th career touchdown and second of the game from 25-yards out.  The Rams failed to find the endzone, but Jeff Wilkins connected on a field goal to make the score 24-10 at the half. Damon Huard fumbled on Kansas City's next offensive drive but was recovered by Kyle Turley&#8212;in his first game back from an injury.  The Rams' defensive unit stopped the Chiefs from securing the lead.  The Chiefs' defense gave up some major yardage on the Rams' next turn on offense.  Penalties to St. Louis cost them over 60&#160;yards, as the Chiefs' offense suffered a penalty for defensive pass interference from Dexter Coakley and a facemask to Larry Johnson from Oshiomogho Atogwe.  The Chiefs would go on to secure the win with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Kris Wilson to make the score 31-17.  The game ended as the clock ran out as the Chiefs retained the Governor's Cup and advanced to 5-3. Several Chiefs players were injured throughout the game including Brian Waters, Tamba Hali, Derrick Johnson, Greg Wesley, Keyaron Fox and Kendall Gammon.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Gonzalez have in the first half?",
