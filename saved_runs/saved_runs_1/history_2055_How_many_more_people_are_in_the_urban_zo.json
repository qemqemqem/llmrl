Counties with over \u2154 urban population are Hunedoara County, Bra\u0219ov County and Constan\u021ba County, while with less than a third are D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County (30.06%) and Giurgiu County  and Teleorman County. Bucharest is the capital and the largest city in Romania, with a population of over 1.8 million in 2011. Its larger urban zone has a population of almost 2.2 million, which are planned to be included into a Bucharest metropolitan area up to 20 times the area of the city proper. Another 19 cities have a population of over 100,000, with Cluj-Napoca and Timi\u0219oara of slightly more than 300,000 inhabitants, Ia\u0219i, Constan\u021ba, Craiova and Bra\u0219ov with over 250,000 inhabitants, and Gala\u021bi and Ploie\u0219ti with over 200,000 inhabitants. Metropolitan areas in Romania have been constituted for most of these cities.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more people are in the urban zone population compared to the population in Bucharest?",
