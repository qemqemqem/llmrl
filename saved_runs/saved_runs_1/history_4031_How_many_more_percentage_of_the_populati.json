Following an influx of immigrants to Galway during the 2000s, approximately 20% of the population is non-Irish. Slightly more than half of this group (11.3%) are white Europeans, coming from Poland and other Central European and Baltic States, such as Latvia and Lithuania. Smaller numbers of Asian and African immigrants come from East Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. In the 2006 Census, 15.4% of the population were aged 0\u201314, 76.1% were aged 15\u201364, and 8.5% were aged over 65. 51.9% of the population were female and 48.1% were male.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more percentage of the population were aged 15-64 than aged 0-14?",
