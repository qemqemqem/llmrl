    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Bengals began Round 1 of 2006's Battle of Ohio in the Week 2 home-opener against the Cleveland Browns.  Cincinnati scored first on a 22-yard TD pass to wide receiver Kelley Washington from Carson Palmer.  The Browns responded with a 30-yard FG by kicker Phil Dawson.  The Bengals extended their lead with an 8-yard TD pass to wide receiver Chad Johnson.  In the second quarter, kicker Shayne Graham made a 37-yard field goal as time ran out to give Cincinnati a 17-3 halftime lead. In the fourth quarter, Graham would give the Bengals a 37-yard field goal, and the Browns responded with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Reuben Droughns.  Two touchdown runs by Bengal running back Rudi Johnson put the game out of reach.  The Browns scored one more touchdown with quarterback Charlie Frye's 2-yard run, but it was not enough as the Bengals improved to 2-0. Several Bengals were injured during this game. David Pollack, a 2nd year linebacker, suffered a non-paralyzing broken neck (fracturing his C6 vertebra), and would miss the rest of the season. Safety Dexter Jackson suffered a severe ankle sprain. Center Rich Braham also suffered a leg injury, and was expected to be out for some weeks. Wide receiver, Chad Johnson appeared dinged up too. On his 8-yard touchdown reception, he appeared to have an injured shoulder (made noticeable by his unenthusiastic post-score celebratory dance). Even though he continued to play, he appeared to be in pain. Later in the game, during a Browns interception, he was blocked by a Brown's safety, which gave him a concussion. Special team starter, Tab Perry, injured his hip, and missed a number of games.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were made in the second half?",
