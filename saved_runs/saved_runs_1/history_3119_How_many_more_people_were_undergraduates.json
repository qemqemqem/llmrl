Law applications accepted increased by 10%. Mason enrolled 33,917 students for Fall 2013, up 956 (+3%) from Fall 2012. Undergraduate students made up 65% (21,990) of the fall enrollment, graduate students 34% (11,399), and law students 2% (528). Undergraduate headcount was 1,337 higher than Fall 2012 (+7%); graduate headcount was 262 lower (\u22122%); and law student headcount was 119 lower (\u221218%). Matriculated students come from all 50 states and 122 foreign countries. As of fall 2014, the university had 33,791 students enrolled, including 21,672 undergraduates, 7,022 seeking masters degrees, 2,264 seeking doctoral degrees and 493 seeking law degrees.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more people were undergraduates in 2014 than in 2012?",
