    "problem_text": "Context:\nGame SummaryThe unbeaten Colts played the undefeated Patriots in Week 9 in a heavily hyped game, dubbed \"Super Bowl XLI&#189;\" by Chris Berman. Colt kicker and former Patriot Adam Vinateri gave the Colts an early lead with a 21-yard field goal. However, Randy Moss would help give the Patriots their first lead of the game on a four-yard touchdown reception, his twelfth of the season, tying a Patriots record. After Vinateri kicked another field goal to make it a 7-6 game, the Colts would regain the lead just before the half when Joseph Addai caught a \"dump-off\" pass by Peyton Manning and took it 73&#160;yards into the endzone, giving the Colts a 13-7 lead. Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski provided all the third quarter scoring off a 34-yard field goal to cut the Colts lead to 13-10. In the 4th quarter, Manning ran in a play from the Patriot one-yard line to give the Colts a 20-10 lead. However, the Patriots came right back and, with the aid of a 33-yard reception from Donte' Stallworth, the Pats got their first touchdown of the half off a 4-yard catch by Wes Welker. Forcing a punt by the Colts, Kevin Faulk then gave the Patriots a 24-20 lead off a 13-yard reception to give the Patriots their first lead of the half. The Patriots then stopped a drive by the Colts when Peyton Manning was hit by Jarvis Green and fumbled the ball into the hands of Rosevelt Colvin with just under three minutes to go. On third and ten with no timeouts left for the Colts, the Patriots ended any hope for Indianapolis when Welker made a big 12-yard catch to give the Patriots a first down. The Patriots were able to kneel the ball after that to finish off the Colts and the Colts fell to 7-1, losing their first game of the season. The game was costly in other ways, as some seven starters were knocked out, including Dallas Clark.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the colts lead with in the third quarter?",
