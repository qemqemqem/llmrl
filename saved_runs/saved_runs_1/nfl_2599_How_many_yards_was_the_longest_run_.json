    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter defeating the Minnesota Vikings 44-31 for the last time in the Metrodome, the Packers returned to Lambeau to take on the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football. The Bears were without Jay Cutler (groin), so Josh McCown made his first start in the 2013 season. The Packers moved down the field with ease on their first possession, with Rodgers completing a 27-yard pass to Jordy Nelson followed by Eddie Lacy's 16-yard run. However, the drive stalled when Aaron Rodgers was sacked by Shea McClellin on 3rd and 8, so the Packers settled for a 30-yard field goal for the 3-0 lead. Josh McCown then led a drive that ended with a 23-yard TD pass to Brandon Marshall, taking a 7-3 lead. It soon became apparent that Aaron Rodgers couldn't return to the game because of an injury suffered on the McClellin sack. Instead, Seneca Wallace trotted onto the field on the Packers' second possession. It ended with a tipped pass that was intercepted by Julius Peppers. The Bears' punt after their 3-and-out was blocked by Jamari Lattimore and recovered by Chris Banjo, taking possession at the Chicago 32. On the very next play, James Starks bursted through the middle for a 32-yard TD run, taking a 10-7 lead. In the 2nd quarter, the Bears took a 14-10 lead following a 1-yard run by Matt Forte. They added a 24-yard field goal at the end of the half to lead 17-10 at halftime. Early in the 3rd quarter, Eddie Lacy sprinted to the Chicago 1-yard line on a 56-yard gain, and tied the game at 17-17 following a 1-yard run by Lacy. The Packers successfully recover the ensuing onside kick, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal to take a 20-17 lead. The Bears responded with a 6-yard TD pass to Alshon Jeffery, taking a 24-20 lead. With 9:48 left in the 4th quarter, the Bears sustained an 18 play, 8:58 minute drive that ended with a 27-yard field goal to make it 27-20 with 53 seconds remaining in the game. The Packers tried to make a comeback, but after a 15-yard pass to Jordy Nelson, Seneca Wallace was sacked twice, first by Corey Wootton then by Shea McClellin, and time expired. With the 20-27 loss, the Packers' 6-game winning streak against the Chicago Bears was snapped, and the Packers fell to 5-3. It was confirmed later in the week that Aaron Rodgers suffered a fractured left collarbone, and Packers Head Coach Mike McCarthy stated that his playing status will be determined \"week to week.\" He ended up missing 7 weeks, only to make his return against the same Bears in Week 17 for the NFC North Championship.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest run?",
