    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the Titans, the Cowboys flew to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome for a Week 6 duel with the Minnesota Vikings.  Dallas delivered the opening punch in the first quarter as quarterback Tony Romo found wide receiver Roy Williams on a 15-yard touchdown pass.  The Vikings answered with quarterback Brett Favre completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Camarillo.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys regained the lead as Romo and Williams hooked up with each other again on a 2-yard touchdown pass. Minnesota took the lead in the third quarter as wide receiver Percy Harvin returned the half's opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, followed by running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas tied the game as Romo connected with rookie wide receiver Dez Bryant on a 31-yard touchdown pass.  The Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell making a 38-yard field goal. With only 5 seconds left in the game, the Cowboys attempted a lateral play, in a fashion similar to The Play, River City Relay, and the Music City Miracle. However, Romo was then flagged for throwing a forward pass after crossing the line of scrimmage, ending the game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown pass of the game?",
