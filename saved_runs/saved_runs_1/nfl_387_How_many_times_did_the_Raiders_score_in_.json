After a scoreless first quarter, St. Louis struck first in the second quarter with kicker Jeff Wilkins nailing a 24-yard and a 34-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, the Rams increased their lead with RB Steven Jackson's 4-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, St. Louis wrapped up the win with Jackson's 19-yard TD run.  With the win, the Rams improved their record to 6-8.  It was the first Rams shutout win since 2003.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many times did the Raiders score in the game?",
