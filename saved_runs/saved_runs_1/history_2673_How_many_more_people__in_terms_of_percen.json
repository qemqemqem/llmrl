According to the 2010 census results Guam was 26.3% Overseas Filipino,  2.2% Korean diaspora, 1.6% Overseas Chinese and 2% other Asian. The 2010 census showed the Northern Mariana Islands was 50% Asian of which 35.3% were Filipino, 6.8% Chinese, 4.2% Korean and 3.7% other Asian (mainly Japanese diaspora, Bangladeshi diaspora and Thai people). The 2010 census for the Federated States of Micronesia showed 1.4% were Asian while statistics for Nauru showed 8% of Nauruans were Chinese. The 2005 census results for Palau showed 16.3% were Filipino, 1.6% Chinese, 1.6% Vietnamese and 3.4% other Asian (mostly Bangladeshi, Japanese and Korean).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more people, in terms of percentage, were Filipino compared to Chinese and Vietnamese combined in Palau as of 2005?",
