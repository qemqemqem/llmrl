    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Cowboys opened the season at home against their rival, the New York Giants, led by the quarterback-receiver tandem of Eli Manning and young Odell Beckham Jr.. Tony Romo came back late in the fourth quarter and nailed the game-winning drive to Jason Witten to give Dallas a narrow 27-26 victory. The victory, however, was bittersweet as Dez Bryant broke his foot in the second half. The injury required surgery and he is expected to miss 10-12 weeks. Cameras caught Bryant congratulating his teammates in the locker room after a close victory. Romo on Bryant injury: \"You can't replace Dez Bryant.\" Three days after, the NFL came forward and apologized to the New York Giants for 2 blown calls. The first call led to a Cowboy touchdown due to a wrong Pass Interference call which set up the Cowboys 1st and Goal on the 2 yard line and the second was a blown Defensive Holding call which would have set up the Giants first and Goal with the Cowboys having no Time Outs remaining and 1:36 left on the clock.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Cowboys win by?",
