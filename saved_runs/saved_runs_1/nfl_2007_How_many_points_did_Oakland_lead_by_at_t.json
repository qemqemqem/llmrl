    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Raiders traveled to Denver for a week 7 AFC matchup for the ages. The game began with a 42-yard touchdown pass by Jason Campbell to tight-end Zach Miller to put the Raiders ahead 7-0 with 10:44 remaining in the first quarter. But only 8&#160;seconds later, on the Broncos' first play from scrimmage, Kyle Orton threw an interception to Chris Johnson which was returned 30&#160;yards for a touchdown. The Raiders now led 14-0 with 10:36 remaining. But then on the Broncos' next possession, Denver fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Oakland. The Raiders capitalized on the turnover with a 4-yard rushing touchdown by Darren McFadden. But the Raiders were not yet done, forcing the Broncos to a 4th down situation on their next drive and eventually making them turn the ball over on downs, adding a field goal to the score later in the quarter for the Raiders. At the end of the first quarter, Oakland led 24-0. Oakland began the second quarter with a 19-yard touchdown pass from Jason Campbell to Darren McFadden to make the Raiders lead 31-0. Later in the quarter, McFadden again rushed for another touchdown, making the Raiders lead over the Broncos 38-0. But the Broncos would not give up, scoring a touchdown in the dying minutes of the first half when Kyle Orton hooked up with Knowshon Moreno in the end zone. At the end of the half, Oakland led 38-7. Early in the second half, the Broncos again scored a touchdown and brought Oakland's lead down to just 38-14. But the Raiders weren't done scoring yet, scoring 21 unanswered points, including a 57-yard touchdown run by Darren McFadden. At the end of the third quarter, the Raiders led 59-14. No scoring happened in the fourth quarter as the Raiders benched their starters. The Raiders deafeated Denver 59-14. With the win, not only the Raiders improve to 3-4, they've set a new team record with 59 points scored and beat the Broncos for the third straight year in Denver.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did Oakland lead by at the end of the first half?",
