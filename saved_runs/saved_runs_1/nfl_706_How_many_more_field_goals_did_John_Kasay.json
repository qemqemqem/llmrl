In the first quarter, New Orleans trailed early as Panthers kicker John Kasay got a 23-yard field goal.  The Saints would respond with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 25-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Panthers retook the lead with Kasay's 35-yard field goal.  New Orleans would respond with Mare kicking a 28-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Saints took the lead with FB Mike Karney getting a 2-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  However, in the fourth quarter, Carolina came back to win with QB David Carr completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith, along with Kasay's 52-yard field goal as time ran out. With the loss, the Saints fell to their first 0-4 start since 1996.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more field goals did John Kasay make than Olindo Mare?",
