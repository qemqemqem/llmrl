Of the 60\u00a0million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, 8\u00a0million were killed, 7\u00a0million were permanently disabled, and 15\u00a0million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%. In Germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to disease. By the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had killed approximately 100,000\u00a0people in Lebanon. Between 5 and 10 million people died in the Russian famine of 1921. By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920-1922. Numerous anti-Soviet Russians fled the country after the Revolution; by the 1930s, the northern Chinese city of Harbin had 100,000\u00a0Russians. Thousands more emigrated to France, England, and the United States.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more were seriously injured than killed between 1914 and 1918?",
