    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from a miserable home loss to the Cardinals, the Bears flew to Candlestick Park for a Week 10 Thursday night duel with the San Francisco 49ers, led by head coach Mike Singletary (former Bears linebacker). After a scoreless first quarter, Chicago would trail in the second quarter as 49ers running back Frank Gore got a 14-yard touchdown run.  The Bears would close out the half with a 50-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould.  In the third quarter, Chicago would inch closer with Gould's 38-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, San Francisco would answer with kicker Joe Nedney making a 21-yard field goal.  The Bears would get have a late game drive go deep into 49er territory, but an interception by safety Michael Lewis ended any hope of a win. Quarterback Jay Cutler (29/52 for 307 yards) would throw for a career-worst 5 interceptions in one game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points were scored in the first quarter?",
