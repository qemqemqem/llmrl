    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to build on their win in Oakland, the Browns flew to Bank of America Stadium for a Week 5 match-up with the Carolina Panthers.  The Browns would score first, as kicker Phil Dawson got a 41-yard field goal, but the Panthers did better, as CB Richard Marshall intercepted a pass that bounced off WR Dennis Northcutt's hands and returned it 30 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, Cleveland's struggles continued as Panthers QB Jake Delhomme completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Keyshawn Johnson for the only score of the second period. Johnson was being covered by safety Brodney Pool, who was forced to play cornerback due to injuries to Gary Baxter and Leigh Bodden. In the third quarter, both sides would get field goals, as Carolina kicker John Kasay kicked a 22-yarder, while Dawson made a 47-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Browns got closer with Dawson's 22-yard field goal, but the Panthers managed to put the game away, as Kasay got a 19-yard field goal and gave the Panthers a huge lead.  Even though Dawson would make a 32-yard field goal, Cleveland's struggles continued to hurt them, as they went into their bye week at 1-4.  0-2 against NFC opponents.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal of the game?",
