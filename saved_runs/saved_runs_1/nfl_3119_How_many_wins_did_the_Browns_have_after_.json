    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns headed to Buffalo to try to collect their first win of the season, but the Bills routed the Browns 33-13. With the loss, the Browns fell to 0-14 and became the first team to lose 17 consecutive regular season games since the St. Louis Rams in the 2008 and 2009 seasons.  The Browns also became the fourth team to start a season 0-14, joining the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers (went winless in a 14-game season), 1980 New Orleans Saints (went 1-15), and the 2008 Detroit Lions (went 0-16).  The Browns also tied their franchise record for total losses in a single season.  The Browns also became the first team since the 2013 Houston Texans, who lost their last 14 games after starting their season 2-0, to have 14 straight losses in a single season. On December 21, OT Joe Thomas was voted to his 10th consecutive Pro Bowl. Thomas now holds the Browns record for most Pro Bowls, passing Pro Football Hall of Famers Jim Brown (nine) and Lou Groza (nine). Thomas joins Pro Football Hall of Famers Merlin Olsen (14), Mel Renfro (10), Barry Sanders (10) and Lawrence Taylor (10) as the only players in NFL history to make the Pro Bowl in each of their first 10 seasons. Thomas' streak of 10 consecutive Pro Bowls is the longest active streak in the NFL.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many wins did the Browns have after the game?",
