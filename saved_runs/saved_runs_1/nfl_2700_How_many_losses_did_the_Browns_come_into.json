    "problem_text": "Context:\nFor the Browns, this would mark the third straight regular season game that they played in: that would be decided by 3 or fewer points, and that would have a game-winning field goal in the final ten seconds of the fourth quarter.  In a tightly contested match, the Browns led 21-17 heading into the fourth. A series of errors (including a missed 50 yard field goal try and a blocked field goal attempt) prevented them from scoring, while the Ravens scored 6 unanswered.  Throughout the first three periods, the Browns were 5/7 on third down conversions; they were 0/4 on third down conversions and gained only one first down in the decisive fourth quarter.  Ravens K Justin Tucker kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired.   With the loss, the Browns suffered their first home loss of the season as their record fell to 1-2 entering the bye week.  The Browns also fell to 1-12 against the Ravens with Joe Flacco as the QB under center.  Victories by the Bengals and the Steelers would leave the Browns in sole possession of last place in the AFC North. The Browns were the only team in the NFL not to have a turnover in the first three games of the season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many losses did the Browns come into this game with?",
