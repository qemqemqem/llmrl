    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter their win against the Baltimore Ravens 19-17, the Packers, wearing their throwback jerseys of blue and yellow, returned home to Lambeau Field to take on the Cleveland Browns. Both James Jones and Randall Cobb would be inactive for the game, and Jarrett Boykin got his first career start. He had a breakout game, catching 8 passes for 103 yards and 1 TD. After forcing the Browns to punt on their opening possession, the Packers quickly struck with a 10-yard TD pass to Jermichael Finley. After Brandon Weeden's pass was intercepted by Davon House on the next drive, the Packers took advantage with a 1-yard TD run by Eddie Lacy to take a 14-0 lead in the 1st quarter. After Cleveland scored on a 46-yard field goal, the Packers responded with a 26-yard field goal to take a 17-3 lead at halftime. In the 3rd quarter, the Browns scored on a 44-yard field goal to make it 17-6. Early in the 4th quarter, the Browns decided to go for it on 4th down and 15 on the Packers 31-yard line. The pass to Jordan Cameron in the endzone was incomplete, and the Packers took over. On the drive, Jermichael Finley was carried off the field on a stretcher after suffering a neck injury. The Packers capped off that drive with a 1-yard TD pass to Jordy Nelson. They followed it up with a 20-yard TD pass to Jarrett Boykin, taking a 31-13 win. About two weeks after the game, Jermichael Finley was put on IR. With the win, the Packers extend their winning streak to 3, and improve to 4-2.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points was the margin of victory?",
