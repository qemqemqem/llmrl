    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their embarrassing road loss to the Steelers, the Seahawks went home for Sunday Night football, as they hosted the winless New Orleans Saints.  In the first quarter, Seattle trailed early as a blocked punt would result in New Orleans RB Pierre Thomas returning the loose ball 5 yards for a touchdown, along with the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the 'Hawks continued to trail as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Eric Johnson, while WR Lance Moore got a 7-yard TD run.  The Seahawks would respond with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Ben Obomanu.  However, New Orleans went back to work with Brees completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Marques Colston.  Seattle would end the half with kicker Josh Brown getting a 52-yard field goal.  After a scoreless third quarter, the 'Hawks tried to rally in the fourth quarter, but all they could get was Hasselbeck's 22-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did Seattle have at halftime?",
