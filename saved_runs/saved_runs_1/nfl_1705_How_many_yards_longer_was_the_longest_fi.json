    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Cardinals' ninth game was an NFC West rivalry re-match against the Seahawks. In the first quarter the Cardinals took the early lead as RB Tim Hightower got a 2-yard TD run. The Seahawks replied with RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run. The Cardinals trailed with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 41-yard field goal, but they answed back with kicker Jay Feely nailing a 23-yard field goal. The Cardinals struggled further with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 63-yard TD pass to WR Deon Butler. This was followed in the third quarter by a 34, 19 and 23-yard field goal from Mare. In the fourth quarter Mare got another 19-yard field goal to put the Seahawks up 29-10. The Cardinals responded with QB Derek Anderson making a 2-yard TD pass to WR Early Doucet (With a successful 2-point conversion as Anderson found WR Larry Fitzgerald), but the Seahawks put the game away with RB Justin Forsett getting a 4-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was the longest field goal compared to the shortest?",
