    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to end their four-game skid, the Vikings returned home for a Week 12 fight against the Arizona Cardinals. This game was notable for the return of Head Coach Dennis Green, who formerly coached the Vikings and now works for the Cardinals. Right out of the gate, the Vikes trailed early as Cardinals RB J.J. Arrington returned the opening kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings would respond with RB Chester Taylor getting a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Cards kicker Neil Rackers helped increase Arizona's lead with a 21-yard and a 50-yard field goal. Afterwards, Minnesota struck back with QB Brad Johnson completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Marcus Robinson. In the third quarter, the Vikings took the lead with Johnson completing a 9-yard TD pass to rookie WR Billy McMullen, while kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 40-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Vikes managed to put the icing on the game with Johnson completing a 3-yard TD pass to FB Jeff Dugan. The Cardinals tried to fight back, with Strong Safety Adrian Wilson returning a fumble 99 yards for a touchdown (with a failed two-point conversion) and QB Matt Leinart completing a 9-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin. Minnesota held on to snap its four-game losing streak. With the win, the Vikings improved to 5-6.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Neil Rackers' longest kick of the first half compared to his shortest?",
