    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to avoid an 0-3 start, the Vikings stayed at home for a Week 3 duel with the Carolina Panthers. Due to a poor performance, QB Tarvaris Jackson was benched in favor of veteran QB Gus Frerotte. In the first quarter, Minnesota trailed early as Panthers kicker John Kasay got a 43-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Carolina increased its lead with RB Jonathan Stewart getting a 2-yard TD run. The Vikes would respond with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 28-yard field goal, along with CB Antoine Winfield sacking Panthers QB Jake Delhomme, fumbling the ball, and Winfield returning that fumble 19-yards for a touchdown just before halftime, the key play in the Viking victory. Head coach Brad Childress said a day later that Winfield had a half-second left before it was ruled an incomplete pass. In the third quarter, the Vikings got the lead as Frerotte completed a 34-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota sealed its victory with Longwell nailing a 32-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Longwell kick?",
