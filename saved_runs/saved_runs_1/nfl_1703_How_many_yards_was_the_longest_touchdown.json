    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Cardinals' seventh game was an NFC duel with the Buccaneers at University of Phoenix Stadium. In the first quarter the Cardinals took the lead when QB Max Hall made a 3-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald. The Buccaneers replied with OLB Geno Hayes returning an interception 41 yards for a touchdown. The Cardinals led again in the second quarter with RB Beanie Wells getting a 1-yard TD run, but the Buccaneers went on a scoring rally with QB Josh Freeman making a 47-yard TD pass to WR Mike Williams, and CB Aqib Talib returning an interception 45 yards for a touchdown. This was followed by kicker Connor Barth hitting a 21-yard field goal, and in the third quarter with RB LeGarrette Blount getting a 15-yard TD run. The Cardinals also went on a rally to take the lead back with RB LaRod Stephens-Howling making a 30-yard TD run, which was followed by ILB Gerald Hayes recovering a fumble and running 21 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. Then QB Derek Anderson found Fitzgerald on a 5-yard TD pass. The Buccaneers scored once more to take the win with Blount getting a 1-yard TD run. With the loss, Arizona recorded back to back losses for the first time since the 2008 season, and fell to 3-4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown run?",
