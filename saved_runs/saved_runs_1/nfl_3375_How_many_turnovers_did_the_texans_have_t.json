One was a 94-yard pass to Robert Woods (the third-longest touchdown pass in Rams history) and 1 a pass to Sammy Watkins. Meanwhile, the Rams defense caused 4 turnovers on the Texans 2 of which were strip sack recoveries from Connor Barwin and Samson Ebukam while the other 2 were interceptions (one was by strong safety Blake Countess). The game ended in a Rams victory with a 33-7 score and the fourth-straight win. With that win, the Rams improved to 7-2, their best start in a season since 2001. They now have at least one home victory against all 31 other franchises.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many turnovers did the texans have that were interceptions?",
