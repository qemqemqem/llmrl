    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to break their current losing streak the Chargers played on home ground for an AFC duel with the Titans. In the first quarter the Chargers trailed early when the Chargers' punt was blocked by Nick Schommer out of bounds for a safety. The Chargers replied with FB Mike Tolbert getting a 1-yard TD run. The Chargers fell behind with kicker Rob Bironas nailing a 21-yard field goal, followed in the second quarter by QB Vince Young completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Craig Stevens. The Chargers struggled further with RB Chris Johnson getting a 29-yard TD run. The Chargers then went on a scoring rally with RB Ryan Mathews making a 7-yard TD run, followed in the third quarter by kicker Kris Brown making a 34-yard field goal. Then QB Philip Rivers completed a 48-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates, and then Brown made a 36-yard field goal. The lead was narrowed with Young finding WR Nate Washington on a 71-yard TD pass (with a failed 2-point conversion), but couldn't do anything after Rivers got a 13-yard TD pass to RB Darren Sproles (PAT aborted).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown pass?",
