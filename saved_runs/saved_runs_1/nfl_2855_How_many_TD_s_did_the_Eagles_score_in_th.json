Philadelphia exploited Niner mistakes to score first half touchdowns on a blocked punt recovery, an interception return and a punt return. But the defense never allowed a point by the Eagles offense, who had led the league in scoring through the first 3 weeks of the season, and on the strength of two Colin Kaepernick touchdown passes and four Phil Dawson field goals, they took a late 26-21 lead. Late in the game the Eagles moved to the Niner one yard line, but they turned the ball over on downs, and the Niners held on for the win. The Niners outgained the Eagles 407-213, and held the ball for 42:17.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many TD's did the Eagles score in the first half?",
