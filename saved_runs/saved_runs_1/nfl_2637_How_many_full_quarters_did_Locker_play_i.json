Following three touchdown throws, the Jets sacked Jake Locker out of the game in the third quarter as Locker was sidelined the next two weeks with a hip injury.   Geno Smith was picked off twice while in the fourth quarter he was sacked at his own goal line by Karl Klug; he attempted to switch the ball behind his back and Klug fell on the fumble for a touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many full quarters did Locker play in this game?",
