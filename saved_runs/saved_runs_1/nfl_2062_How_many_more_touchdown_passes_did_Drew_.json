I misunderstood the question and only counted the difference in the number of touchdown passes between the two quarterbacks. The correct answer is that Drew Brees threw two more touchdown passes than Alex Smith. To solve the problem, I went through the passage and identified the number of touchdown passes thrown by each quarterback. To solve it better, I could have written down the number of touchdown passes for each quarterback and then subtracted them to find the difference.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Seahawks, the 49ers played their Week 2 home opener against the defending Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints on Monday night. San Francisco trailed early in the first quarter as center David Baas' high snap deep within Niner territory resulted in a safety.  The Saints would add onto their lead as quarterback Drew Brees completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back Reggie Bush.  The 49ers would respond in the second quarter with quarterback Alex Smith finding running back Frank Gore on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Niners would take the lead in the third quarter as rookie running back Anthony Dixon got a 2-yard touchdown run, but New Orleans would answer with Brees' 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end David Thomas.  In the fourth quarter, the Saints would add onto their lead as kicker Garrett Hartley got a 46-yard and a 19-yard field goal.  San Francisco would tie the game with Gore's 7-yard touchdown run, followed by Smith's 2-point conversion pass to tight end Vernon Davis.  However, New Orleans would get the last laugh as Hartley made the game-winning 37-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more touchdown passes did Drew Brees get than Alex Smith?",
