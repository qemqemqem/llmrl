The Bears scored first in the first quarter with a 54-yard field goal from Robbie Gould to take a 3-0 lead for the only score of the quarter. In the 2nd quarter, the Bears increased their lead when Michael Bush scored a touchdown on a 5-yard run to make the score 10-0. The Rams responded with Greg Zuerlein's 56-yard field goal to shorten the lead to 10-3 at halftime. In the 3rd quarter, the Rams drew closer as Zuerlein kicked a 46-yard field goal to make the score 10-6 for the only score of the quarter. But in the 4th quarter, the Bears held on for victory as Gould kicked a 22-yard field goal to make it 13-6 and then on the Rams' next possession, Sam Bradford was intercepted by Major Wright who then returned it 45 yards for a touchdown to make it 20-6. Gould kicked a 37-yard field goal to make the final score 23-6 as the Rams dropped to 1-2.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Rams lose by?",
