    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Chiefs flew to the RCA Dome for a Week 12 intraconference duel against the defending Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts, in a rematch of last year's wildcard battle.  This would be the game in which second-year quarterback Brodie Croyle would be given the start. After a scoreless first quarter, Kansas City struck first with kicker Dave Rayner getting a 47-yard field goal.  The Colts would tie the game before halftime as kicker Adam Vinatieri managed to get a 27-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Indianapolis took the lead as RB Joseph Addai got a 3-yard TD run.  The Chiefs would respond and tie the game with Croyle completing a 19-yard TD pass to rookie WR Dwayne Bowe.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Colts sealed the win as Vinatieri nailed the game-winning 24-yard field goal. The game was also the final outing of Priest Holmes, who suffered a neck injury in the fourth quarter. Holmes announced his retirement later into the week on November 21.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals longer than 20 yards did Adam Vinatieri kick?",
