    "problem_text": "Context:\nFollowing their bye week, the Packers flew to Denver to take on the Broncos on Monday Night Football. In the first quarter, Bronco quarterback Jay Cutler opened the scoring with a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Scheffler. On the first play of the ensuing series Brett Favre completed a 79-yard touchdown to rookie wide receiver James Jones. In the second quarter, rookie kicker Mason Crosby converted a 19-yard field goal, followed by a 26-yard field goal, and the Packers took a 13-7 lead into halftime. In the third quarter, Broncos kicker Jason Elam converted a 45-yard field goal to cut Green Bay's lead to 3 points. In the fourth quarter, after getting the ball back with 2:27 remaining in the game, Cutler led a drive that began on the Bronco seven-yard line down the length of the field to the Green Bay four-yard line. On a 3rd and 1 Cutler attempted a quarterback draw to win the game, but Ryan Pickett stopped Cutler for no gain on the play. With no time outs remaining Elam and the kicking unit ran onto the field and converted a field goal to tie the game on the final play of the quarter. Greg Jennings called heads and won the overtime coin toss, allowing Green Bay to receive the ball to begin overtime. On the first play, Favre threw an 82-yard touchdown pass to Jennings, who had outrun Bronco cornerback Dr&#233; Bly for the catch. This was Favre's 13th TD pass of 75&#160;yards or more, most of any player in NFL history. Favre also becomes the first Packers player to throw two touchdown passes of 75&#160;yards or more in the same game. Only three quarterbacks have accomplished the feat since 1990. Ryan Grant ran for 104&#160;yards, the first Packer to break the 100&#160;yard rushing mark this season. With the win (their first ever in Denver), the Packers improved to 6-1. On November 1, 2007 Aaron Kampman was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Month for October, having recorded 5.5 sacks during that time period. Brett Favre was voted the Fedex Air and Ground NFL Player of the Week award for games played on October 28 - 29, the third time this season he has received this award. Wide receiver James Jones of the Packers was announced as the Diet Pepsi 2007 Rookie of the Week for games played on October 28-29. Jones made three receptions for 107&#160;yards including a first-quarter 79-yard touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were made in the 2nd half?",
