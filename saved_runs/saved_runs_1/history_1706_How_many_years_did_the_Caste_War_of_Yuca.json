    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n was a conflict that lasted from 1847 to 1901. It began with the revolt of native Maya people led by Maya chiefs Jacinto Pat and Cecilio Chi, against the population of European descent called \"Yucatecos\", who had political and economic control. A lengthy war ensued between the Yucateco forces in the north-west of the Yucat\u00e1n and the independent Maya in the south-east. It officially ended with the occupation of the Maya capital of Chan Santa Cruz by the Mexican army in 1901, although skirmishes with villages and small settlements that refused to acknowledge Mexican control continued for over another decade. Adam Jones wrote: \"This ferocious race war featured genocidal atrocities on both sides, with up to 200,000 killed.\" Because of the conflict, on November 24, 1902, Yucat\u00e1n had a second territorial division when Porfirio D\u00edaz decreed the creation of the Federal Territory of Quintana Roo, with capital in the port of Payo Obispo . In little more than half a century, Yucat\u00e1n lost more than two thirds of its original territory.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did the Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n last?",
