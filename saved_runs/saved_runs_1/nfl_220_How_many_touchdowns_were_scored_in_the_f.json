    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off a two-game winning streak, the Dolphins stayed at home for a Week 11 fight against teammate Daunte Culpepper's former team, the Minnesota Vikings.  In the first quarter, the Vikings struck first as RB Chester Taylor got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Dolphins took to the water as kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 44-yard field goal, while QB Joey Harrington got an 11-yard TD pass to TE Justin Peelle.  In the third quarter, Minnesota came closer with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Vikings took a three-point lead, as Longwell kicked a 19-yard field goal.  However, Miami wouldn't have any of that, as the defense stepped up and made decisive plays.  Free Safety Renaldo Hill returned a fumble 48 yards for a touchdown, while DE Jason Taylor returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown.  Minnesota would get one more touchdown (another 1-yard TD run by Taylor), but Miami ran out the clock to preserve their 3rd victory in a row.  With the victory, the Dolphins improved to 4-6.  The Dolphins' rushing yardage was a franchise low (&#8722;3 yards), and a team record for the Vikings' defense.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were scored in the first quarter?",
