    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to break a two-game losing streak, the Broncos traveled to Arrowhead Stadium for a AFC West rivalry rematch against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Broncos trailed in the first quarter, as Chiefs' quarterback Matt Cassel threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Leonard Pope, in what would be the game's only touchdown. The Broncos responded in the second quarter, with placekicker Matt Prater nailing a 25-yard field goal, but the Chiefs countered, with a 47-yard field goal by placekicker Ryan Succop just before halftime. After a scoreless third quarter, the Broncos cut into the lead with a 41-yard field goal by Prater, but Kansas City's defense prevented anything else from happening. With the loss, not only were the Broncos officially eliminated from postseason contention, but they also exceeded their loss total from their previous two seasons.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Chiefs score in the third quarter?",
