    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Panthers came into Buffalo looking to recover from a close loss in Seattle the previous week. In the third quarter Cam Newton bombed a 40-yard touchdown pass to Ted Ginn, giving the Panthers a 14-6 lead. Fred Jackson then ran in a 4-yard touchdown to put the Bills behind 14-12. The Bills converted the 2-point conversion, putting the score at 14-14. The Panthers would go on to stall twice in the red zone, forcing them to kick field goals to make the score 20-14. After a Dan Carpenter 48-yard kick, the Panthers got the ball back, marched down the field, but were stuffed on 4th and 1 at the Bills' 22. The Panthers decided to kick the field goal to put them up 23-17. EJ Manuel and the Bills would get the ball back and march down the field. With 20 seconds remaining in the game from the Panthers' 31, EJ Manuel threw an interception, but it was called back due to Luke Kuechly, the linebacker, committing pass interference on what would have been a game-sealing interception. With 2 seconds remaining from the Panthers' 2-yard line, Manuel hit wide receiver Stevie Johnson in the back of the end zone for the score. With the loss, the Panthers would fall to 0-2 and 3-17 when Newton has at least a turnover.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did Buffalo win by?",
