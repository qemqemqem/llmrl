    "commentary_on_process": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. I misunderstood the problem and only added up the total yards of field goals made by Sebastian Janikowski and subtracted the total yards of field goals made by Adam Vinatieri. To solve the problem correctly, I should have added up the total yards of field goals made by Sebastian Janikowski and the total yards of field goals attempted by Adam Vinatieri, and then subtracted the total yards of field goals made by Adam Vinatieri. This would give the difference in total yards of field goals made by the two kickers. Therefore, the correct answer is 163. To solve the problem better, I should have read the problem more carefully and made sure to include all relevant information in my calculations.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Raiders' fifteenth game was an AFC duel with the Colts at home. The Raiders struck immediately after a 99-yard kickoff return was made by Jacoby Ford. They soon trailed with RB Joseph Addai getting a 6-yard TD run, followed by kicker Adam Vinatieri getting a 30-yard field goal. They took the lead again after kicker Sebastian Janikowski hit a 59 and a 38-yard field goal, but trailed for the second time with QB Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard TD pass to TE Jacob Tamme. The Raiders tried to cut the lead with Janikowski nailing a 51-yard field goal, but fell further behind with Manning getting a 4-yard TD pass to WR Blair White. The Raiders tried to keep up with Janikowski making a 45-yard field goal, but the Colts kept going with Manning completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Pierre Gar&#231;on. The Raiders tried to come back after QB Jason Campbell threw a 6-yard TD pass to TE Zach Miller, but the Colts defense prevented any more chances, giving them the loss. With the loss, the Raiders fell to 7-8, and were officially eliminated from postseason contention for the eighth straight year.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more total yards of field goals did Sebastian Janikowski make than Adam Vinatieri?",
