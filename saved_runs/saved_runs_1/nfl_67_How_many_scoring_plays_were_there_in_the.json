    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their primetime sweep over the Bucs, the Panthers stayed at home for the Week 11 fight with the St. Louis Rams.  This game was notable as former teammates Stephen Davis and Will Witherspoon returned as members of the Rams.  After a scoreless first quarter, the Panthers showed dominance as kicker John Kasay nailed a 40-yard field goal, while QB Jake Delhomme completed a 62-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith.  In the third quarter, Kasay continued on improving Carolina's lead with a 34-yard field goal.  Finally, in the fourth quarter, DE Mike Rucker helped put the game away as he sacked Rams QB Marc Bulger in St. Louis' endzone for a safety.  With a strong defensive showing, the Panthers record their first home shutout since 1996 and their first overall since 1998.  With the win, the Panthers improved to 6-4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many scoring plays were there in the first quarter?",
