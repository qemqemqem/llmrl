    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to build on their surprising victory over the Jaguars, the Texans flew to LP Field for an AFC South showdown with the Tennessee Titans.  After a scoreless first quarter, the Texans trailed early, as Tennessee QB Vince Young ran 20 yards  for a touchdown.  Houston would respond with kicker Kris Brown nailing a 27-yard field goal.  However, things started getting ugly as Titans DE Tony Brown returned a fumble 40 yards for a TD.  In the third quarter, QB David Carr lasted for only one drive, which resulted in a fumble recovery for Tennessee.  He would be replaced with back-up QB Sage Rosenfels.  However, a Rosefels interception resulted in Young completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Bobby Wade.  The Texans would respond with Rosenfels completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson.  In the fourth quarter however, CB Pacman Jones returned a punt 53 yards for a touchdown.  Houston would try to retaliate, as Rosenfels completed two touchdown passes (a 1-yarder and a 2-yarder to rookie TE Owen Daniels), but in the end, any hope for a comeback resulted in a fumble, dropping the Texans to 2-5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown plays was Vince Young a part of?",
