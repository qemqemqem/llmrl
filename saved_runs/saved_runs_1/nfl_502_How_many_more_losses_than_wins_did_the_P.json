In the first quarter, Carolina pounced first with kicker John Kasay nailing a 19-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Panthers increased their lead with QB Vinny Testaverde completing a 5-yard TD pass to rookie TE Dante Rosario, while CB Richard Marshall returned an interception 67 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, the 49ers managed to get on the board as QB Trent Dilfer completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Arnaz Battle and a 1-yard TD pass to TE Delanie Walker. Afterwards, Carolina went back to work as RB DeShaun Foster got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers pulled away as Testaverde completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King. With the win, not only did Carolina improve to 5-7, but it even managed to give the Panthers their first home win of the year.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more losses than wins did the Panthers have after this game?",
