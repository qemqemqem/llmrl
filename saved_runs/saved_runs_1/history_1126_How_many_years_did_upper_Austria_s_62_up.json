To solve the problem, I subtracted the starting year (1356) from the ending year (1849) to get the total number of years (493). However, I should have subtracted the starting year (1500) from the ending year (1599) to get the number of years in the 16th century (99), and then added that to the number of years in the other time period (350) to get the total number of years (449). Finally, I should have added one year to account for the fact that the first uprising occurred in 1356. Therefore, the correct answer is 490 years. To solve the problem better, I should have paid closer attention to the time periods given and made sure to account for the first year of the time period.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nUpper Austria had been rebellious for centuries, with 62 known uprisings between 1356 and 1849, 14 of which occurred in the 16th century. However, the Peasants' War of 1626 was the costliest in terms of human life and damage to livestock and property. The war caused Martin Aichinger to lose his farm and begin roaming the country. He eventually became a religious leader who led a popular revolt against aristocratic rule. His revolutionary ideas frightened the rulers so much that they tried to arrest him, leading to another series of uprisings that ended in the Battle on the Frankenberg  in 1636. All of Aichinger's followers were slaughtered during the battle, including the remaining women and children who had been in hiding.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did upper Austria's 62 uprisings span?",
