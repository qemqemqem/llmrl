In the first quarter the Falcons trailed early as WR DeSean Jackson raced through the defense on a 31-yard TD run. Later, QB Kevin Kolb connected with him on a 34-yard TD pass. The Falcons' secondary  continued to struggle when Kolb found WR Jeremy Maclin on an 8-yard TD pass. Facing, a 21-0 deficit,  the Falcons replied with QB Matt Ryan hitting TE Tony Gonzalez on a 1-yard TD pass. This was followed in the third quarter by kicker Matt Bryant hitting a 26-yard field goal. However, the Falcons fell further behind when Kolb found Maclin again on an amazing  83-yard TD pass. The Falcons replied with Ryan hitting Gonzalez, again, on a 13-yard TD pass. The Eagles pulled away with All-Pro kicker David Akers making a 30-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were made in the game?",
