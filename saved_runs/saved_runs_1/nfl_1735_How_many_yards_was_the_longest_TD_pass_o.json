    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Ravens were facing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a team with an identical 7-3 record. However, the Ravens were considered favorites going into the game, given that they had never lost at home during the season, and all Tampa Bay wins were against teams with losing records. Still, they did not take this one lightly. After a scoreless first quarter, the Ravens scored first with a field goal. Tampa Bay later tied it, but Baltimore scored two touchdowns, including one on a 65-yard pass from Todd Heap, to have a 17-3 halftime lead. During a scoreless third quarter, a would be long TD-run from Ray Rice was negated by a controversial call of a penalty on Anquan Boldin. Though the Ravens would never score anymore in the game, they managed to hold off Tampa Bay and allow just one touchdown, enough to prevent their lead from being blown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest TD pass of the first half?",
