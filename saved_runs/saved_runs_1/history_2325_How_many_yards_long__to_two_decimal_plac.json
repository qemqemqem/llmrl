    "problem_text": "Context:\nPlunkett finished the game with 16 out of 25 pass completions for 172 yards and a touchdown. Theismann threw for more yards than Plunkett (243), but was just 16 out of 35 and was intercepted twice.  He was also sacked six times. Branch was the top receiver of the game with six receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown.  Guy punted seven times for 299 yards (42.7 average), with 244 net yards (34.8 average) and planted five of his seven punts inside the 20.  Martin recorded a sack, a pass deflection, and a fumble recovery. Riggins, who had rushed for over 100 yards in his last six postseason games, was held to 64 yards and a touchdown on 26 carries, with his longest gain being just 8 yards. Brown was their top receiver with three receptions for 93 yards.  Tight end Clint Didier caught five passes for 65 yards.  Garrett recorded 100 yards on kickoff returns, and one reception for 17 yards. Part of both of Allens touchdown runs were cutbacks, which, according to New York Daily News writer Larry Fox, burned an overpursuing Redskins defense.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards long, to two decimal places, were Branch's receptions on average?",
