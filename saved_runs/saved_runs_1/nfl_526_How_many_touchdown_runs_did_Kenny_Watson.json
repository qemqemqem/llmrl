    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a four-game skid, the Bengals went home for a Week 7 intraconference duel, as they hosted the New York Jets for the first time in a decade.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Jets QB Chad Pennington completed a 57-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.  Fortunately, the Bengals would respond with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 20-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New York increased its lead with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 24-yard and a 35-yard field goal.  Cincinnati would respond with RB Kenny Watson getting a 3-yard TD run.  The Jets would end the half with Pennington and Coles hooking up with each other again on a 36-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New York added onto its lead with Nugent kicking a 43-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Bengals would respond with QB Carson Palmer completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati's offense took over as Watson added a 1-yard and a 2-yard TD run on to his magnificent day.  Afterwards, the Bengals defense sealed the win with CB Johnathan Joseph returning an interception 42 yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, the Jets end the game with Pennington completing a 32-yard TD pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery. With their four-game skid snapped, Cincinnati kept its playoff hopes alive by improving to 2-4.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown runs did Kenny Watson have in the game?",
