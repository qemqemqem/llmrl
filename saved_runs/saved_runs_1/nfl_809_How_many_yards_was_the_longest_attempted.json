    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their divisional home win over the Cardinals, the 49ers flew to the Edward Jones Dome for a Week 2 divisional duel against their NFC West rival, the St. Louis Rams. In the first quarter, the Niners trailed early as Rams QB Marc Bulger completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, San Francisco would tie the game up with RB Frank Gore getting a 1-yard TD run.  St. Louis would take the halftime lead with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 29-yard field goal In the third quarter, the 49ers took the lead with Gore breaking through a gang of tacklers for a 43-yard TD run, along with the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Rams retook the lead with Wiklins getting a 53-yard field goal.  Fortunately, thanks to a St. Louis goof-up on special teams, the Niners took the lead with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 40-yard field goal.  Near the end the game, the Rams had one last chance to win the game.  Fortunately for San Francisco, Wilkins' 56-yard field goal attempt fell about a yard short of the crossbar. With the win, the 49ers improved to 2-0 for the first time since 1998. Q1 - STL - 6:04 - 12-yard TD pass from Marc Bulger to Torry Holt (Wilkins kick) (STL 7-0) Q2 - SF - 14:57 - Frank Gore 1-yard TD run (Nedney kick) (7-7) Q2 - STL - 9:04 - Jeff Wilkins 27-yard FG (STL 10-7) Q2 - STL - 1:51 - Jeff Wilkins 29-yard FG (STL 13-7) Q3 - SF - 2:43 - Frank Gore 43-yard TD run (Nedney kick) (SF 14-13) Q4 - STL - 10:04 - Jeff Wilkins 53-yard FG (STL 16-14) Q4 - SF - 3:23 - Joe Nedney 40-yard FG (SF 17-16)\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest attempted field goal?",
