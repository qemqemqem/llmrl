    "problem_text": "Context:\nTwo muffed punts hurt the Eagles in their season opener against Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers. After Green Bay's first drive, Philadelphia's punt return man Greg Lewis muffed the punt which resulted in a fumble recovery in the end zone for the Packers. A 53-yard Green Bay field goal put the Eagles in a 10-0 deficit. Sheldon Brown's interception led to a field goal in the second quarter. Jason Avant's nine-yard touchdown reception from Donovan McNabb tied the game, and in the third quarter, David Akers made his second field goal from 47-yards out to make it 13-10 Philadelphia. Favre responded with a 13-play field goal drive to even the score. Later, J. R. Reed muffed a punt and the Packers recovered at the Eagles 31-yard line and Mason Crosby kicked a 42-yard game winner. Brian Westbrook had 131 all-purpose yards and Avant had three catches for 54 yards and a touchdown. The defense collected four sacks, two turnovers, and only allowed 46 rushing yards. This was the only game that the Packers offense did not score a touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many TD's did the Packers get",
