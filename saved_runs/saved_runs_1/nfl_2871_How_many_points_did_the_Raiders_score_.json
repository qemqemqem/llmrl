Before the game, five Rams receivers came out of the tunnel with their hands up in protest to support the Ferguson unrest, causing controversy (see hands up don't shoot). Amid the \"Hands Up\" controversy, the Rams defense harassed the Raiders and struggling new quarterback Derek Carr all game long. The game was best highlighted by two Tre Mason touchdowns, including an 89-yard run. The Rams held the Raiders scoreless with a 52-0 blowout. With the victory, the Rams finished the year 2-2 against all AFC West opponents.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Raiders score?",
