    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Steelers' last game in the 3-game home stand was against the Browns.  Landry Jones started the game but left due to injury and was replaced by Ben Roethlisberger.  In the first quarter, the Steelers grabbed an early lead as Chris Boswell nailed a 24-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  The Browns tied it up however at 3-3 when Travis Coons kicked a 23-yard field goal.  The Steelers would retake the lead later on in the quarter when Boswell nailed a 34-yard field goal for a 6-3 game.  In the second quarter, it was all Steelers when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 4-yard pass (with a successful 2-point conversion) for a 14-3 lead followed up by Roethlisberger finding Martavis Bryant on a 32-yard pass for a 21-3 lead at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Steelers went back to work as Boswell kicked a 25-yard field goal for a 24-3 game for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Johnny Manziel found Gary Barnidge on a 7-yard pass (with a failed PAT) for a 24-9 game.  The Steelers later on would wrap the game up when Roethlisberger and Brown hooked up again this time on a 56-yard pass (with a failed PAT) for the final score of 30-9. With the win, the Steelers head into their bye week at 6-4, and finally won a game within their division while also winning consecutive conference games for the first time in the season.  The team also improves to 3-2 when Ben doesn't start and also finishes 2-1 in the 3-game home stand. The defense also stood out by sacking Manziel 6 times and got 3 turnovers.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the second longest touchdown pass?",
