    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Raiders began their 2008 campaign at home against their AFC West rival, the Denver Broncos, in the second game of Monday Night Football's doubleheader.  In the first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Broncos QB Jay Cutler completed a 26-yard TD pass to WR Eddie Royal.  In the second quarter, the Raiders continued to trail as kicker Matt Prater got a 26-yard field goal, while FB Michael Pittman got a 3-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Oakland got even more black and blue as Cutler completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson, while Prater nailed a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Raiders finally got on the board as QB JaMarcus Russell completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Ashley Lelie.  Denver ended its rout with RB Selvin Young's 5-yard TD run and Pittman's 1-yard TD run.  Oakland would close the game with Russell's 4-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry. With the dismal loss, the Raiders began their season at 0-1 for the sixth straight year.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did Oakland score?",
