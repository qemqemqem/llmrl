    "problem_text": "Context:\n The Browns headed into Kansas City for their last road game of the year to take on the Chiefs in Week 15. The Browns and Chiefs traded field goals in the first quarter, and then Josh Cribbs returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, setting an NFL record with his 7th kickoff return for a touchdown. After another Phil Dawson field goal in the second, the Chiefs scored three straight touchdowns to take a 24-13 lead. However, Cribbs again ran a kickoff back for a touchdown, this time for 103 yards and extending his NFL record to eight kickoff return touchdowns. In the second half, Jerome Harrison rushed for three touchdowns and amassed a filibuster-proof majority of his 286 rushing yards. This set a Browns' rushing record for a single game, was the record for most rushing yards in the NFL this season, and was the third most rushing yards in a game in NFL history. Matt Cassel's final desperation pass ricocheted off the cross bar, and the Browns defeated the Chiefs 41-34, with their highest point total of the season. With the win, the Browns improved to 3-11 and finished the season 2-6 on the road. Cribbs was named the AFC special teams player of the week for the second straight week. On December 21, Mike Holmgren was hired by the Browns to take over as their president. His duties will include personnel management, and he may hire a general manager to assist him. He also will have the power to replace Eric Mangini as head coach if he so chooses.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more billions of dollars do the Summer games cost than the winter games?",
