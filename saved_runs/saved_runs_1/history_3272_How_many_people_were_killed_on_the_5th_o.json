On 14-15 September about 900 Polish Jews, mostly intelligentsia, were targeted in parallel shooting actions in Przemy\u015bl and in Medyka; this was a foreshadowing of the Holocaust to come. Roughly at the same time, in Solec Kujawski (14 September), 44 Poles killed; soon thereafter in Chojnice, 40 Polish citizens; Gmina K\u0142ecko, 23 Poles; B\u0105dk\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, 22 Poles; Dyn\u00f3w, two hundred Polish Jews. Public executions continued well beyond September, including in municipalities such as Wierusz\u00f3w County, Gmina Besko, Gmina Gidle, Gmina K\u0142ecko, Gmina Ryczyw\u00f3\u0142, and Gmina Siennica, among others.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many people were killed on the 5th of September?",
