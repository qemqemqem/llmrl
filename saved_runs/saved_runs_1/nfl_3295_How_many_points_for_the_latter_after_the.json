    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns were a Vegas road favorite for the first time since 2012 and an overall favorite for the first time since 2015.  The Colts drew first blood in the first quarter when backup QB Jacoby Brissett ran for a 5-yard touchdown to make the score 7-0 for the quarter's only points.  The Browns managed to tie it up in the second quarter when Duke Johnson Jr. ran for a 19-yard touchdown to make it 7-7.  Though the Colts then responded with 3 straight touchdowns:  Brissett ran for another one from 7 yards out followed up by a 61-yard passing touchdown from him to T.Y. Hilton.  Lastly, the Frank Gore ran for a 4-yard touchdown for lead changes of 14-7, 21-7, and 28-7.  The Browns managed to make the score 28-14 at halftime when DeShone Kizer found David Njoku on a 1-yard pass.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Colts managed to increase their lead when Adam Vinatieri nailed a 33-yard field goal to make it 31-14.  The Browns tried to rally with 2 more touchdowns:  Kizer connected with Kenny Britt on an 11-yard pass to make it 31-21.  This would be followed up by Kizer running in for a touchdown himself from a yard out to make it 31-28.  The Browns failed to recover the onside kick and it sealed the win for the Colts.  With the loss, the Browns fell to 0-3. The team also lost their 15th straight road game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points for the latter after the 19 touchdown from Duke?",
