    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Vikings, the Panthers went home for a Week 4 NFC South duel with the Atlanta Falcons.  In the first quarter, Carolina pounced first with rookie RB Jonathan Stewart getting an 8-yard TD run.  The Falcons responded with kicker Jason Elam getting a 33-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Atlanta crept closer as Elam kicked a 33-yard field goal.  Carolina would reply with QB Jake Delhomme completing a 56-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith.  The Falcons closed out the half with Elam getting a 44-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Panthers answered with kicker John Kasay nailing a 44-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Carolina closed the game out with Delhomme completing a 36-yard TD pass to WR Muhsin Muhammad. During the game, Muhsin Muhammad (8 receptions for 147 yards and a touchdown) became the Panthers All-Time WR Leader in Receptions (600) and TD Receptions (45).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown pass?",
