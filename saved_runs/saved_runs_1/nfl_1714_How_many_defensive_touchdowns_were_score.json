Matt Bryant converted a 24-yard field goal. The Browns replied and took the lead with QB Seneca Wallace's 19-yard TD pass to RB Peyton Hillis. The Falcons tried to cut the lead when Bryant made a 30-yard field goal, but was expanded again in the 3rd quarter with kicker Phil Dawson hitting a 19-yard field goal. After that, the Falcons scored when QB Matt Ryan connected with WR Roddy White on a 45-yard TD pass. The game was a defensive drag out the rest of the way. In the 4th quarter DE Kroy Biermann returned an interception 41 yards to the endzone for a touchdown, sealing the Falcons' 4th straight win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many defensive touchdowns were scored?",
