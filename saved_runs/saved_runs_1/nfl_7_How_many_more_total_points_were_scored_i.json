    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Cards visit Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin to take on the Packers.  Arizona has not visited Lambeau Field since a 49-24 loss in the final game of the 1999 season on January 2, 2000.  The Cardinals defeated the Packers 20-13 in the last meeting between the teams on September 21, 2003 at Sun Devil Stadium.  Unfortnately, their 2003 victory stayed as a memory, as the Cardinals dropped their seventh-straight game, heading into their Bye Week 1-7. In the wake of this loss, concern for the remainder of the once-promising season was so strong, DE Bertrand Berry led a players-only meeting at the Cardinals HQ in Tempe on November 7. Some days earlier, Berry openly questioned his teammates' commitment to success during an interview on a local radio program.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more total points were scored in Arizona's last game of the 1999 season relative to the Cardinals and Packers game?",
