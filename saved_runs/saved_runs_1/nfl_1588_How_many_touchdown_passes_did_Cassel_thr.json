I found that he threw a touchdown pass to Mark Bradley in the second quarter and another to Bobby Wade in the fourth quarter, making the total number of touchdown passes thrown by him in the game 2. Since there was no mention of any other touchdown passes thrown by him, I was confident that my answer was correct.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Eagles entered their second home game of the season at 1-1 and facing an 0-2 Kansas City Chiefs team. Kevin Kolb once again started in place of the injured Donovan McNabb and starting running back Brian Westbrook, starting left guard Todd Herremans (who had been out the first two weeks as well), and number two wide receiver Kevin Curtis all missed the game as well. Nevertheless, the Eagles struck first as rookie RB LeSean McCoy, starting in place of Westbrook, scored on a five-yard touchdown scamper. Later in the first quarter, Kevin Kolb scored his first ever NFL rushing TD on a quarterback sneak to put Philadelphia up 14-0 at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Matt Cassel scored the Chiefs' first touchdown of the game on a nice pass to a leaping Mark Bradley over the head of CB Ellis Hobbs to cut the Eagles' lead to seven. However, Philadelphia bounced back as Kevin Kolb hooked up with DeSean Jackson for a 64-yard score. The Eagles tacked on an Akers field goal to go up 24-7 at the half. The Philadelphia defense which had been great all day continued to do their jobs in the third quarter and the Kansas City began to step up their game as the only score of the third period was a 38-yard field goal kick by David Akers, putting the Eagles up 27-7. In the fourth quarter, Kevin Kolb tossed another touchdown pass, this time to starting third-year TE Brent Celek. It was Philly's last score of the game and put them up 34-7. Matt Cassel began to rally the Chiefs and drove them down the field, scoring a touchdown on a nine-yard pass to Bobby Wade, making the score 34-14. However, the Chiefs were unable to get on the board again and 34-14 was the final score.  Kolb is the first quarterback to throw at least 300 yards in his first 2 career starts. With the win, the Eagles went into their bye week at 2-1.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes did Cassel throw?",
