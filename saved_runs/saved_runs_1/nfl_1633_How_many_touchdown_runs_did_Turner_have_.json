    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their shutout home win over the Rams, the 49ers stayed at home for a Week 5 duel with the Atlanta Falcons. The Niners would trail early in the first quarter as Falcons running back Michael Turner got a 7-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Matt Ryan's 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roddy White. San Francisco would answer with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Glen Coffee. After starting the second quarter with a 39-yard field goal from kicker Joe Nedney, Atlanta took over with Ryan hooking up with White again on a 90-yard touchdown pass and Turner's 3-yard & 1-yard touchdown runs. The Falcons would then close out the game with kicker Jason Elam's 40-yard field goal in the third quarter and Ryan's 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth. With the loss, the 49ers entered their bye week at 3-2.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown runs did Turner have?",
