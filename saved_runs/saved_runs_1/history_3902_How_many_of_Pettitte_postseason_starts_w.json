He also holds the all-time postseason record for most starts (42) and innings pitched in the postseason (263). He was the second starting pitcher in history to win three series-clinching games (ALDS, ALCS and World Series) in the same postseason (2009). Derek Lowe did the same in 2004, but with one of the wins in relief, and additionally, Pettitte won the regular season game in which the Yankees clinched the division. When Pettitte started Game 3 of the 2009 World Series, he passed Christy Mathewson and Waite Hoyt, with the second most World Series starts. Whitey Ford is in front with 22 starts. Pettitte has played in 8 different World Series (7 with the Yankees, and 2005 World Series with the Astros), and been on the winning end of 19 postseason series - both of which are tops among active players. Andy Pettittes final postseason appearance was on Saturday, October 13, 2012 which was game one of the 2012 ALCS. Pettitte received a no decision in the game which the Yankees would lose in 12 innings.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many of Pettitte postseason starts were not recorded as either a win or a loss?",
