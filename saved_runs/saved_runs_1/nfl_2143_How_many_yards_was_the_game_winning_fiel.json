In the first quarter the Redskins had problems with a three-and-out followed by a punt being returned 87 yards for a touchdown by WR Marc Mariani. They replied with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss, followed in the second quarter by kicker Graham Gano nailing a 19-yard field goal. They lost the lead after kicker Rob Bironas made a 25 and a 32-yard field goal. However, they replied with Gano hitting a 40-yard field goal. The Titans scored with Bironas nailing a 40-yard field goal, but the Redskins replied with Gano making a 42-yard field goal. The decision was made at Overtime after Gano successfully hit a 48-yard field goal to give the Redskins the win, settling the records for both teams at 5-5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the game winning field goal?",
