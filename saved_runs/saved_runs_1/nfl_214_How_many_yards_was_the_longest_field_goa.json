    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Dolphins hoped to carry the momentum from their Week 3 victory, as they traveled to Reliant Stadium to take on the Houston Texans.  After a scoreless first quarter, Miami got on the board first with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 52-yard field goal, but the Texans got a field goal for themselves, as kicker Kris Brown got one from 32 yards out.  In the third quarter, the Dolphins got another field goal, as Mare got one from 29 yards out for the only score of the period.  However, in the fourth quarter, things got very ugly as the Texans got two touchdowns, with QB David Carr on a 1-yard run and WR Andre Johnson getting a 3-yard touchdown reception.  Miami valiantly tried to fight back, as Mare got a 22-yard field goal and QB Daunte Culpepper completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, but in the end, a failed two-point conversion spelled doom for the Dolphins, as Miami failed to come back and would fall to 1-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
