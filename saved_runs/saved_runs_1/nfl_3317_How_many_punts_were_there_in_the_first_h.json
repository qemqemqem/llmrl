    "problem_text": "Context:\nFor a seventh consecutive year, the Broncos kicked off the season at home, in the second half of the opening Monday night doubleheader against the Los Angeles Chargers. After an exchange of punts, a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Trevor Siemian to wide receiver Bennie Fowler III game the Broncos the early lead. The drive was kept alive as the result of a near-interception by Chargers' cornerback Casey Hayward. On the first play of the second quarter, the Chargers countered, with quarterback Philip Rivers connecting on an 11-yard touchdown pass to running back Melvin Gordon, with Ingram leaping above Broncos' safety Justin Simmons in order to reach the goal line. The Broncos re-claimed the lead later in the second quarter, with Siemian rushing for a 1-yard touchdown, then added to their lead on their initial possession of the second half, with another touchdown pass from Siemian to Fowler &#8212; from 6 yards out. The Broncos reached the Chargers' 3-yard line on a 14-play, 78-yard drive that chewed up the last 8:16 of the third quarter, but had to settle on a 20-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus to increase their lead to 24-7. After stopping the Chargers on a 4th-and-1 near midfield, the Broncos' offense committed two turnovers &#8212; an interception of Siemian by Chargers' safety Adrian Phillips and a fumble by running back Jamaal Charles. The Chargers took advantage of both turnovers and narrowed the Broncos' lead to 24-21, with a pair of touchdown passes by Rivers &#8212; a 5-yarder to wide receiver Keenan Allen followed by a 38-yarder to wide receiver Travis Benjamin &#8212; the latter occurring with seven minutes remaining in the game. Following an exchange of punts, the Chargers had one last possession at the two-minute warning and were forced to use their last timeout with 42 seconds remaining. Six plays later, the Chargers were attempting a game-tying field goal to send the game to overtime. Placekicker Younghoe Koo's initial field goal was good; however, it was nullified as the result of Broncos' head coach Vance Joseph calling a timeout in order to ice the kicker. Koo's second attempt was blocked by defensive end Shelby Harris, sealing the win for the Broncos. Vance Joseph and Chargers' head coach Anthony Lynn became the first two head coaches of African American descent to make their coaching debuts in the same game. Beth Mowins, who handled the play-by-play duties for ESPN, became the first woman to call an NFL game since 1987.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many punts were there in the first half?",
