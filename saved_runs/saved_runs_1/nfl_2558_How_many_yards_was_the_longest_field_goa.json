The Lions scored first in the first quarter when Joseph Fuaria caught a 1-yard pass from Matthew Stafford for a 7-0 lead.  In the second quarter, it was all Browns when Brandon Weeden found Chris Ogbonnaya on a 4-yard pass tying the game up 7-7 and taking the lead when Weeden found Greg Little on a 2-yard pass for a 14-7 lead.  This was followed up by Billy Cundiff nailing a 40-yard field goal as the Browns lead 17-7 at halftime.  In the second half however, it was all Lions starting in the third quarter when Stafford found Reggie Bush on an 18-yard pass to come within 3, 17-14.  In the fourth quarter, they took the lead back when Stafford found Fauria on a 23-yard pass for a 21-17 lead followed up by David Akers nailing a 51-yard field goal for a 24-17 lead and finally Stafford and Fauria hooking up again on a 10-yard pass for the final score of 31-17. With their 3-game winning streak snapped, the Browns fell to 3-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
