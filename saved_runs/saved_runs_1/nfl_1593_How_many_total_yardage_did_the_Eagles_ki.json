To solve the problem correctly, I should have added the yardage of the two field goals, which were 45 and 48 yards respectively, resulting in a total of 93 yards. However, the question specifically asked for the total yardage kicked by the Eagles in the second quarter, so I should have only added the yardage of the two field goals, which would have resulted in a total of 83 yards. In the future, I will make sure to read the question more carefully and only include the relevant information in my calculations.",

Philadelphia would trail in the first quarter as Cowboys running back Tashard Choice picked up a 2-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles would respond in the second quarter with a 45-yard and a 48-yard field goal from kicker David Akers, but Dallas would answer with kicker Nick Folk nailing a 22-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Philadelphia would take the lead as quarterback Donovan McNabb found tight end Brent Celek on an 11-yard touchdown pass.  However, the Cowboys struck back in the fourth quarter with Folk's 33-yard field goal and quarterback Tony Romo's 49-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Miles Austin.  The Eagles tried to get a comeback, but could only muster up a 52-yard field goal from Akers.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yardage did the Eagles kick in the second quarter?",
