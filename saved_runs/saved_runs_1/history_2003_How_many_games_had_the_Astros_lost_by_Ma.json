    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn 2005, the Astros started poorly and found themselves with a 15\u201330 record in late May. The Houston Chronicle had written them off with a tombstone emblazoned with \"RIP 2005 Astros\". However, from that low point until the end of July, Houston went 42\u201317 and found themselves in the lead for an NL wild card spot. July saw the best single-month record in the clubs history at 22-7. Offensive production had increased greatly after a slow start in the first two months.  The Astros had also developed an excellent pitching staff, anchored by Roy Oswalt (20\u201312, 2.94), Andy Pettitte (17\u20139, 2.39), and Roger Clemens (13\u20138 with a league-low ERA of only 1.87). The contributions of the other starters\u2014Brandon Backe (10\u20138, 4.76) and rookie starters Ezequiel Astacio (3\u20136, 5.67) and Wandy Rodr\u00edguez (10\u201310, 5.53)\u2014were less remarkable, but enough to push the Astros into position for a playoff run. The Astros won a wild card berth on the final day of the regular season, becoming the first team since the world champion 1914 Boston Braves to qualify for the postseason after being 15 games under .500.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many games had the Astros lost by May of 2005?",
