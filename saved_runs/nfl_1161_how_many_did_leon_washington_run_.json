    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their home win over the Bengals, the Jets flew to Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for a Week 7 duel with the Oakland Raiders, Brett Favre's first trip to the stadium since a 2003 Monday night game played in the aftermath of his father's death.  In the first quarter, New York took flight as kicker Jay Feely got a 40-yard field goal.  The Raiders responded with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 29-yard field goal.  After a scoreless second quarter, Oakland took the lead as QB JaMarcus Russell completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Javon Walker.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets answered with RB Leon Washington getting an 11-yard TD run.  The Raiders regained their lead as Janikowski got a 37-yard field goal. Favre orchestrated a remarkable final drive, culminating in a Feely 52-yard field goal with just 3 seconds left that sent the game into overtime. The Jets nearly won in regulation, but Jerricho Cotchery was tripped up by the last Oakland defender, preventing what would have been a game-winning touchdown. Oakland prevailed in overtime, as Janikowski nailed the game-ending 57-yard field goal, which holds the NFL record for longest FG converted in Overtime.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many did leon washington run?",
