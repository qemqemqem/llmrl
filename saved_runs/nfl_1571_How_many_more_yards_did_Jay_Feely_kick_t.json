    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye week, the Jets stayed at home for a Week 10 duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  New York would trail early in the first quarter with running back Maurice Jones-Drew's 33-yard touchdown run.  The Jets would respond with kicker Jay Feely getting a 32-yard field goal, followed by rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez completing a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery.  In the second quarter, Jacksonville would take the lead as quarterback David Garrard got an 11-yard touchdown run and completed a 26-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Sims-Walker.  New York would close out the half as Feely made a 37-yard field goal. After a scoreless third quarter, the Jets would regain the lead in the fourth quarter with a 40-yard field goal from Feely and a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Thomas Jones (with a failed 2-point conversion).  However, the Jaguars got the last laugh as kicker Josh Scobee booted the game-winning 21-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more yards did Jay Feely kick than the other player who kicked a field goal?",
