    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter 2 straight losses on the road, the Colts returned home to take on the Falcons.  The Falcons dominated scoring 21 unanswered points as Michael Turner would run for a 1-yard touchdown for a 7-0 lead.  It was then followed up by Matt Ryan finding Julio Jones on a 50-yard touchdown pass taking the game to 14-0 in the first quarter.  In the 2nd quarter, Ryan and Jones hooked up again on an 80-yard pass sending the game to 21-0.  The Colts finally got on the board as Jerraud Powers returned an interception 6-yards for a touchdown making the halftime lead 21-7.  In the 3rd quarter, Ryan hooked up with Tony Gonzalez for a 1-yard pass making the score 28-7.  In the 4th quarter, Matt Bryant would kick a 20-yard field goal to send his team for a final score of 31-7. With the loss, the Colts then fell to 0-9 giving them their first losing season since 2001.  With the Dolphins' win over the Chiefs that same week, the Colts remained the league's only team without a win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Ryan's longest pass than his shortest pass?",
