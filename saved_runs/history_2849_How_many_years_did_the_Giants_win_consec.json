    "problem_text": "Context:\nSpringfield has had professional baseball in the past, and according to its current mayor, remains intent on pursuing it in the future. The Springfield Giants of the Single\u2013 and Double-A Eastern League (baseball) played between 1957 and 1965. The team was quite successful, winning consecutive championships in 1959, 1960 and 1961, by startling coincidence the same seasons in which the Springfield Indians won three straight Calder Cup championships in hockey. The Giants played at Pynchon Park by the Connecticut River until relocating after the 1965 season. Pynchon Parks grandstands were destroyed by fire the year after in 1966. Before that time, the Springfield Cubs played in the minor league New England League from 1946 until 1949, after which the league folded; they then played in the International League until 1953. For many years before the Giants, Springfield was also a member of the Eastern League, between 1893 and 1943. In general, the team was named the Springfield Ponies, but it also carried the nicknames of \"Maroons\" (1895), \"Green Sox\" (1917), \"Hampdens\" (1920\u201321), \"Rifles (1932, 1942\u201343) and \"Nationals\" (1939\u201341). The team located closest are the Valley Blue Sox of the New England Collegiate Baseball League who play their games in nearby Holyoke, but house their team offices at 100 Congress Street in Springfield.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did the Giants win consecutive championships?",
