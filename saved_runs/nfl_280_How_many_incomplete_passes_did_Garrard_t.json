    "problem_text": "Context:\nFormer head coach Tom Coughlin returned to Alltel Stadium on Monday night to play against the Jaguars, the team that he led to two conference title games in his tenure there, but it did not go well as the Giants laid an egg, losing 26-10.  After Jacksonville muffed a handoff and punted, the Giants had the ball at the Jacksonville 30 but could only muster a field goal.  Jacksonville answered with a Josh Scobie field goal near the quarter's end. The Jaguars then moved ahead for good with a 10-play, 57-yard drive capped off by a Fred Taylor touchdown run.  Taylor however fumbled at the Giants goalline near the half's end and the score remained 10-3.  Meanwhile, the Giants offense was held to two first downs in the first half and could not generate any threats.  Utilizing a short field in the second half, the Jaguars went ahead 13-3 on a Scobie field goal.  After a forced fumble was overturned by a penalty, Eli Manning and the Giants finally awakened, going 70 yards in 11 plays culminating on a 24-yard catch and run by Plaxico Burress. The Giants were in a great position to stop the Jaguars but David Garrard spun out of a sure sack and rushed for a first down, leading to another Scobie field goal.  On their next possession, the Giants defense got burned again, as wideout Matt Jones caught a pass from Garrard on third and long for 49 yards.  Maurice Jones-Drew scored from three yards out and the Giants were done. Garrard was outstanding on the day completing 19 of 32 passes for over 240 yards and the Jaguars rushed for better than 150 yards.  For the Giants, Jeremy Shockey led the team with seven catches and Tiki Barber was held to only 20 yards rushing in the defeat.  New York's second straight defeat moves them into a first place tie in the tough NFC East with the resurgent Dallas Cowboys and their quarterback Tony Romo. The loss was the Giants' second consecutive.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many incomplete passes did Garrard throw?",
