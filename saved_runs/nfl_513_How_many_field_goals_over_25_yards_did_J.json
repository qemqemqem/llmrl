    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off a last-second road win over the Eagles, the Bears went home for Week 8, donned their alternate uniforms, and played an NFC North rematch with the Detroit Lions. After a scoreless first quarter, Chicago trailed as Lions kicker Jason Hanson got a 26-yard field goal, while RB Kevin Jones got a 4-yard TD run. Afterwards, Hanson increased Detroit's lead with a 52-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bears got on the board with QB Brian Griese completing a 20-yard TD pass to rookie TE Greg Olsen for the only score of the period. The Lions sealed Chicago's doom as Hanson nailed a 20-yard field goal, while Detroit's defense held its ground and got the season-sweep. With the loss, the Bears entered their bye week at 3-5. Q2 - DET - 14:56 - Jason Hanson 26-yard FG (DET 3-0) Q2 - DET - 1:53 - Kevin Jones 4-yard TD run (Hanson kick) (DET 10-0) Q2 - DET - 0:05 - Jason Hanson 52-yard FG (DET 13-0) Q3 - CHI - 5:26 - 20-yard TD pass from Brian Griese to Greg Olsen (Robbie Gould kick) (DET 13-7) Q4 - DET - 14:42 - Jason Hanson 20-yard FG (DET 16-7)\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals over 25-yards did Jason Hanson kick in the first half?",
