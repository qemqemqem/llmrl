    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Raiders traveled to London and were considered the home team in the International Series against the Dolphins.  In the first quarter, they would score first when Derek Carr found Brian Leonhardt on a 3-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead.  Later on, the Dolphins got on the board when Caleb Sturgis kicked a 41-yard field goal to shorten the lead to 7-3.  This was the beginning of 35 consecutive points for the team as in the 2nd quarter they took the lead when Ryan Tannehill found Mike Wallace on a 13-yard touchdown pass, Lamar Miller ran for a touchdown from 9 yards out, and then Tannehill found Dion Sims on an 18-yard touchdown pass for leads of 10-7, 17-7, and the eventual halftime score of 24-7.  In the 3rd quarter, the Dolphins went back to work as Lamar Miller ran for another touchdown from 1 yard out for a 31-7 lead before Cortland Finnegan returned a fumble 50 yards for a touchdown for a 38-7 lead.  In the 4th quarter, the Raiders were able to wrap up the scoring when Backup QB Matt McGloin found Andre Holmes on a 22-yard touchdown pass for the eventual final score of 38-14. With the loss, the Raiders went 0-4 heading into their bye week.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes longer than 15 yards were there?",
