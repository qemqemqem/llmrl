    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their Bye Week, the Titans went home for an AFC South battle with the Houston Texans.  After a scoreless first quarter, Titans QB Vince Young started the scoring with a 20-yard TD run.  Afterwards, Texans kicker Kris Brown would kick a 27-yard field goal.  Tennessee would strike back with DE Tony Brown returning a fumble 40 yards for a touchdown.  In the third quarter, Young would complete a 20-yard TD pass to WR Bobby Wade, while Houston QB Sage Rosenfels (who replaced starting QB David Carr early in the quarter) completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson.  In the fourth quarter, Adam \"Pacman\" Jones helped the Titans boost their lead by returning a punt 53 yards for a touchdown.  The Texans would try to fight back, as Rosenfels completed a 1-yard TD pass to rookie TE Owen Daniels (Extra Point Attempt Failed) and a 2-yard TD pass to Daniels (2-Point Attempt Failed).  In the end, Tennessee would get consecutive victories, as the Titans improved to 2-5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total points were scored in the first quarter?",
