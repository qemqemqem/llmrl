In the first quarter, Denver trailed early as Dolphins kicker Dan Carpenter got a 45-yard and a 47-yard field goal, along with CB Will Allen returning an interception 32 yards for a touchdown.  The Broncos would answer with QB Jay Cutler completing a 2-yard TD pass to rookie WR Eddie Royal.  In the second quarter, Miami answered with Carpenter getting a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver tried to rally as kicker Matt Prater got a 50-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Dolphins replied with Carpenter nailing a 41-yard field goal.  The Broncos tried to come back as Cutler completed a 1-yard TD pass to rookie FB Peyton Hillis.  However, Miami pulled away as RB Ronnie Brown got a 2-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals of at least 40 yards did  Dan Carpenter make?",
