    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn 1620, he crushed the Commonwealth army at the Battle of \u0162u\u0163ora . The campaign was suspended for the winter but, in 1621, both sides resumed hostilities. In 1621, an army of 100,000-250,000 soldiers , led by Osman II, advanced from Constantinople and Edirne in April, towards the Polish frontier. The Polish army had 8,280 hussars, 8,200 cossack style cavalry , 1,400 Lisowski cavalry, 2,160 western cavalry, 6,800 Polish infantry, 5,800 western infantry, 800 Hungarian infantry and 25,000 Zaporozhian Cossacks. The Turks, following their victory in the Battle of \u0162u\u0163ora, had high hopes of conquering Ukraine , and perhaps even toppling the Commonwealth entirely and reaching the Baltic Sea. This time, however, they were stopped by a Commonwealth army, aided by a large Cossack detachment, at the Battle of Khotyn. The 65,000 Poles and Cossacks were able to withstand an Ottoman army three times the size throughout the month of September. When the Polish cavalry rallied forth in October they broke the will of the besiegers and the Sultan sued for peace. The ensuing peace treaty resulted in no border change but the Commonwealth agreed to stop its interference in Moldavia. Both sides claimed victory, as the Commonwealth saw the battle of Khotyn as a successful stopping of the Ottoman invasion of its mainland and the Ottoman Empire achieved its goal of removing the impending threat on the Moldavian lands. The Polish-Ottoman border would remain relatively peaceful until the Polish-Ottoman War  and the Polish-Ottoman War .\n\nQuestion:\nHow many soldiers did the Polish Army consist of?",
