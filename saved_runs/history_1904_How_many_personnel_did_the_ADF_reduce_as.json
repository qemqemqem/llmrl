During the 1990s the strength of the ADF was reduced from around 70,000 to 50,000 permanent personnel as a result of budget cuts and the outsourcing of some military functions. The ADF began to grow from 2000 after the defence white paper released that year called for an expansion to the militarys strength, though the size of the military decreased between the 2003\u201304 to 2005\u201306 financial years due to problems with attracting further recruits. By 2009\u201310 the ADF was above its budgeted size, leading to reductions until 2014\u201315. The size of the ADF grew between the 2014\u201315 and 2016\u201317 financial years. The ADF has not met its recruitment targets over the period since the 1995\u201396 financial year.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many personnel did the ADF reduce as a result of budget cuts?",
