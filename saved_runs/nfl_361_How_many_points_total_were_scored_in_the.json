    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Seahawks held on to defeat the New York Giants 42-30 after leading 42-3 going into the 4th quarter. Prior to the game the Giants had complained to the NFL about the level of crowd noise at Qwest Field and suggested that some of the noise was artificial. Last year the Giants were called for 11 false start penalties in a 24-21 overtime loss at Seattle. The complaint became public and the predictable result was a boisterous Seattle crowd and inspired play from the team. Deion Branch saw his first action with the Seahawks as he caught two passes for 23 yards and ran once for eight yards. One day after the game, the Seahawks reported that MVP Running Back Shaun Alexander had a cracked bone in his foot that would sideline him for a few weeks. With the win the Seahawks improved to 3-0 and increased their home game streak to 12 games.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points total were scored in the game?",
