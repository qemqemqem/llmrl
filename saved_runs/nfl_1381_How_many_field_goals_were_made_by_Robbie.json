Before the game, a pregame ceremony was held for the late Walter Payton, who died exactly 10 years ago on November 1. Chicago got off to a fast start in the first quarter as kicker Robbie Gould made a 37-yard and a 29-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Bears would add onto their lead as Gould booted a 32-yard field goal, followed by running back Matt Fort&#233; got a 1-yard touchdown run.  In the third quarter, the Browns would get onto their board with a 1-yard touchdown run by quarterback Derek Anderson (with a blocked PAT).  Afterwards, Chicago would continue their dominating day with a 10-yard touchdown run by Fort&#233;.  The Bears would then close out the game in the fourth quarter with cornerback Charles Tillman returning an interception 21 yards for a touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were made by Robbie Gould?",
