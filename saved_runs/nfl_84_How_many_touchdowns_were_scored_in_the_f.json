    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye-week, the Bengals traveled to Raymond James Stadium for a Week 6 fight with the Buccaneers.  After a scoreless first quarter, Cincinnati took an early lead, as quarterback Carson Palmer threw a 33-yard TD pass to wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh for the only score of the half. In the third quarter, the Bucs would tie the game, as quarterback Bruce Gradkowski completed a 2-yard TD pass to tight end Alex Smith. The Bengals would regain the lead when kicker Shayne Graham kicked a 37-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Graham would help Cincinnati increase their lead with a 47-yard field goal. During  the Buccaneers' final drive, on 1st down, after entering the red zone, defensive end Justin Smith apparently made the first sack of Gradkowski for the game, during a solo tackle. However, the officiating crew felt Smith drove the Gradkowski's head into the ground, and penalized the Bengals for roughing the passer. During the play, Smith caused a fumble which was recovered by the Bengals. When the recovery was overturned due to the controversial call, Tampa Bay kept possession of the ball. On fourth down, the Bucs scored an 8-yard TD pass from Gradkowski to wide receiver Michael Clayton. Originally, the catch was ruled incomplete, but replays proved that Clayton managed to break the plane of the goal line before losing the ball. With less than&#160;:30 left in the game, the Bengals drove from their 30-yard line to Buccaneer territory. With&#160;:06 left, they attempted a 62-yard field goal against the wind, but missed. With the loss, Cincinnati fell to 3-2. Penalty ControversyIn a post-game interview when Marvin Lewis was asked how Justin Smith might have avoided drawing the controversial roughing the passer penalty during the attempted sack, he responded \"I don't know. I guess you have to cuddle him to the ground.\" Justin Smith said \"I've never seen anything like that in my six years in the NFL.\" The official who made the call \"must have season tickets down here.\" He further explained \"The dude (QB) ducked\", suggesting it wasn't the force of Smith tackling but the QB's effort to double-over and protect the ball that made it appear he was being forced into the ground head first. Houshmandzadeh said \"You might as well put a red jersey on (Gradkowski) and play two-hand touch.\"\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns were scored in the first half?",
