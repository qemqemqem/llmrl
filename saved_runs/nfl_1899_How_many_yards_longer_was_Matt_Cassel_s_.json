    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to increase their winning streak the Chiefs played at home ground for an interconference duel with the 49ers. In the 2nd quarter, the Chiefs scored first when QB Matt Cassel made a 31-yard TD pass to WR Dexter McCluster. The lead was narrowed when kicker Joe Nedney hit a 51-yard field goal. But the Chiefs started to rally with kicker Ryan Succop getting a 32-yard field goal, followed by Cassel making a 45-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe. Then Cassel made an 18-yard TD pass to TE Tony Moeaki. This was followed in the 4th quarter by RB Thomas Jones making a 3-yard TD run. After that, the Niners replied with QB Alex Smith making a 12-yard TD pass to WR Josh Morgan. With the win, not only did Kansas City enter its bye week at 3-0, but it also marked their first 3-0 start since 2003.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Matt Cassel's longest touchdown pass over his shortest?",
