    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their horrendous home loss to the Broncos, the Raiders flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 2 AFC West showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs. In the first quarter, Oakland came out punching as kicker Sebastian Janikowski nailed a 56-yard and a 25-yard field goal. After a scoreless second quarter, rookie RB Darren McFadden picked up his first-ever career touchdown in the third quarter on a 19-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Raiders increased its lead with Janikowski getting a 40-yard field goal. The Chiefs would respond with their only score of the game as QB Tyler Thigpen completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez (along with a two-point conversion pass to fullback Mike Cox).  Oakland would close out the game with rookie RB Michael Bush getting a 32-yard TD run. Darren McFadden (21 carries for 164 yards and a touchdown) would become the first rookie Raider to run for 100 yards since Bo Jackson in 1987.  Also, the Raiders' combined rushing attack would reach 300 yards for the first time since November 1987. The defense's improvement from Week 1 showed, as they limited Kansas City to 8 points, which is the lowest that Oakland ever allowed since December 28, 2002 (0 points allowed, also against Kansas City).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did the Chiefs score?",
