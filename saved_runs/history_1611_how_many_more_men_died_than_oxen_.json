By August the 15th, with his army profoundly demoralised, afflicted by the monsoon weather and suffering from shortage of supplies, the Adil Shah ordered the steady withdrawal of his forces, having lost over 8,000 men, 4,000 horses, 300 elephants and over 6,000 oxen in the campaign. He abandoned 150 pieces of artillery in the river. By December 13, 1571, the Shah formally requested peace with the Portuguese.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many more men died than oxen?",
