    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their road win over the Bills, the Saints went home for a Week 4 interconference duel with the New York Jets. New Orleans would deliver the game's first points as kicker John Carney got a 34-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the defense went to work. Safety Darren Sharper would return an interception 99 yards for a touchdown, followed by defensive end Will Smith forcing an endzone fumble by sacking Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez, which allowed defensive tackle Remi Ayodele to land on the ball for a touchdown. Afterwards, New York closed out the half with kicker Jay Feely's 38-yard field goal. The Jets would begin a comeback attempt in the third quarter with running back Thomas Jones getting a 15-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Saints would close out the game with running back Pierre Thomas' 1-yard touchdown and the defense making an impressive stand. With the win, New Orleans would enter its bye week at 4-0.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards shorter was Carney's first half field goal compared with Feely's?",
