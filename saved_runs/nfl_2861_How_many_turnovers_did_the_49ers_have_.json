While the defense held Seattle to a touchdown and four field goals, the Niners only managed 164 yards of offense and one third quarter field goal. The offense, which traditionally collapsed this season in the face of second half adjustments, never got untracked at all, averaging 3.2 yards per pass and 3.6 yards per rush. Two Colin Kaepernick interceptions and a Perrish Cox fumble were the difference in the game. After the game, 49ers owner Jed York apologized to fans on Twitter for his team's poor performance.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many turnovers did the 49ers have?",
