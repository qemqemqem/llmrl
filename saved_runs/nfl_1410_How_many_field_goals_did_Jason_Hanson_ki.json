    "problem_text": "Context:\nLooking to snap a four-game losing streak, the 1-8 Browns flew to Ford Field for a Week 11 interconference duel with the 1-8 Detroit Lions. Both teams began the game with field goals, as Cleveland kicker Phil Dawson made a 44-yard field goal while Lions kicker Jason Hanson got a 31-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Browns' offense exploded as quarterback Brady Quinn completed a 59-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi, a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chansi Stuckey, and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Detroit would answer with quarterback Matthew Stafford completing a 26-yard touchdown pass to running back Aaron Brown. The Lions would tie the game in the second quarter as Stafford hooked up with running back Kevin Smith on a 25-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 75-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson. Afterwards, Cleveland would end the half with Dawson nailing a 29-yard field goal. Detroit would take the lead in the third quarter with Stafford's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Will Heller, the Browns would pick up a safety after Stafford was called for intentional grounding from his own end zone. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland regained the lead with Quinn's 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Michael Gaines (followed by running back Jamal Lewis getting a 2-point conversion run). The Lions would take over, and with no time left, Browns safety Brodney Pool intercepted the ball. However, cornerback Hank Poteat was flagged for pass interference in the end zone. Since the game cannot end on a defensive penalty, Detroit was given one un-timed down from the Browns' 1-yard line and Stafford completed the game-winning touchdown pass to tight end Brandon Pettigrew. With the loss in the 1-8 battle, Cleveland fell to 1-9 assuring them that they would finish last in their division.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Jason Hanson kick?",
