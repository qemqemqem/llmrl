To solve the problem, I carefully read the given context and identified that there was only one field goal made by the Browns kicker Phil Dawson, and it was a 25-yard field goal. However, I missed the fact that the problem asked for field goals between 20 and 30 yards, which means that there were actually two field goals made between that range. To solve the problem better, I should have paid closer attention to the specific range mentioned in the question and double-checked my answer before submitting it.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill searching for their first win, the Bengals went home for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cleveland Browns in Round 1 of 2008's Battle of Ohio.  With QB Carson Palmer out with a sore right elbow, back-up QB Ryan Fitzpatrick was named the starter. In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Browns kicker Phil Dawson got a 25-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Bengals took the lead with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 42-yard and a 45-yard field goal.  After a scoreless third quarter, Cleveland regained the lead in the fourth quarter with QB Derek Anderson completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards, along with RB Jamal Lewis getting a 1-yard TD run.  Cincinnati would respond with Fitzpatrick completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Chad Ocho Cinco, yet the Browns pulled away with Dawson nailing a 29-yard field goal. With yet another loss, the Bengals fell to 0-4 while the Browns improved to 1-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were there between 20 and 30 yards?",
