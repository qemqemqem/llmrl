In the first quarter, Brady hooked up with Graham on a two-yard touchdown pass for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Dillon got a one-yard touchdown run, while Brady hooked up with Caldwell on a 54-yard touchdown pass.  Late in the quarter Packers quarterback Brett Favre was sacked by Tedy Bruschi and was knocked out of the game with injury to his right (throwing) wrist.  In the third quarter, Brady threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Watson for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, New England put the game away with Brady throwing his fourth touchdown pass of the day to Maroney, a 19-yard strike.  With the win, the Patriots improved to 7-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many games have the Patriots won this season?",
