    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Giants started off hot right away against the Cowboys on Monday Night Football.  Eli Manning hit Plaxico Burress deep down the field for a touchdown and linebacker Lavar Arrington sacked quarterback Drew Bledsoe for a safety and a 9-0 lead.  Arrington however would be lost for the season, tearing his Achilles tendon in the 2nd quarter.  The Cowboys got back into the game on a one-yard run by Bledsoe, but gave the momentum back as cornerback Sam Madison made a big play, intercepting Bledsoe at the goalline late in the half, keeping the Giants ahead 12-7. In the second half, Bill Parcells relieved Bledsoe with young backup Tony Romo.  The Giants intercepted Romo right away as linebacker Antonio Pierce caught a deflected ball.  The Giants cashed in as Manning hooked up with Jeremy Shockey for a short touchdown.  Following a Brandon Jacobs touchdown run on 4th down, the Giants opened up a 26-7 lead.  Although the Cowboys threatened, the defense preserved the victory as reserve cornerback Kevin Dockery intercepted Romo and ran 96 yards for the clinching score.  The Giants also held Terrell Owens to under 100 yards receiving. The Giants defense was the story however, notching six more sacks including two from Strahan, and one apiece from Arrington and Osi Umenyiora.  On offense, Tiki Barber shined again, rushing for 114 yards, while Brandon Jacobs added 40 yards.  Quarterback Eli Manning maintained his poise to overcome a shaky game to throw for 189 yards and two touchdowns.  The win moves the Giants to 4-2 and one half a game ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles. The game drew the biggest audience in the history of cable television with an average viewership of 16,028,000, besting the previous high-water mark set during a 1993 the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) debate between vice president Al Gore and presidential hopeful H. Ross Perot. Also notably, DE Michael Strahan managed to tie with the legendary LB Lawrence Taylor for the most official sacks in franchise history (132.5).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total points were scored by halftime?",
