Since the question asked for the duration of the renewed war, I subtracted 1832 from 1833 to get the answer of 1. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have taken notes while reading the passage to keep track of the important details.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nDuring the Mexican War of Independence from Spain  the Yaqui did not participate on either side. It was when Occidente passed a law in 1825 making the Yaqui its citizens and subjecting them to taxes that the Yaqui decided to go to war, since they had not previously been subjected to taxes.  The first fighting was at Rahum.  The movement was encouraged by Pedro Leyva, a Catholic priest and took the Virgin of Guadalupe as its symbol. The Yaqui coalesced around Juan Banderas as their leader.  Banderas managed to get the Mayos, Opatas and Pimas to join in the war against the Mexican government.  Occidente was so affected by the war that the capital was moved from Cosala to Fuerte. In 1827 Banderas' forces were defeated by Mexicans in the vicinity of Hermosillo.  This defeat was partly due to the Yaquis having primarily bows and arrows, while the Mexicans had guns.  After this defeat, Banderas negotiated a peace with Occidente, in which he was granted pardon, and recognized as captain-general of the Yaqui town, and was given a salary. In 1828 the office of captain-general was abolished, and Occidente government reasserted its right to tax the Yaqui, as well as proposing a plan for allotting the Yaqui lands.  In 1832 Banderas renewed the war against the Mexican authorities, in cooperation with Dolores Guti\u00e9rrez, a chief of the Opata people. In 1833 Banderas and Guti\u00e9rrez were executed after their forces were defeated in a battle near Buenavista, Mexico.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did the renewed war against the Mexican authorities last before Banderas was executed?",
