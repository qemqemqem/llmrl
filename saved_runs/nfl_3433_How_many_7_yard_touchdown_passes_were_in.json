    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing back from their bye week, the Steelers traveled to Indianapolis to take on the Colts.  Neither team scored in the first quarter.  But in the second, the Colts grabbed an early lead when Jacoby Brissett found Donte Moncrief on a 60-yard pass to make it 7-0.  Adam Vinatieri tacked on a 48-yard field goal to make it 10-0.  The Steelers got on the board later on in the quarter when Chris Boswell kicked a 41-yard field goal to make the halftime score 10-3.  In the third quarter, the Colts went back to work when Brissett found Chester Rogers on a 61-yard pass to make the score 17-3.  Though the Steelers would score a touchdown when Ben Roethlisberger found Juju Smith-Schuster on a 7-yard pass (with a failed PAT) to make it 17-9.  Getting the ball back deep in Colts territory after a Ryan Shazier interception, the Steelers managed to tie the game up in the fourth quarter when Roethlisberger found Vance McDonald on a 7-yard pass (with a successful 2-point conversion) to make it 17-17.  The defense would hold the Colts off in the last quarter.  The Steelers got the ball back and were able to complete the game-winning drive when Boswell sealed the game with a 33-yard field goal to make the final score 20-17.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many 7-yard touchdown passes were in the game?",
