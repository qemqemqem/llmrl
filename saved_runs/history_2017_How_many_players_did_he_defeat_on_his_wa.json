    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn July 2013, he made it to his first final of the year at the Hall-of-Fame Championships, defeating Matthew Ebden, Prakash Amritraj, Jan Hernych, and John Isner on the way. He was beaten by Nicolas Mahut having served for the championship at 5\u20134 in the second set. His form continued at the 2013 BB&T Atlanta Open, defeating \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin 6\u20134, 6\u20134, Rhyne Williams 7\u20136, 6\u20134 and Ivan Dodig 1\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20130 in the quarterfinals. Hewitt played John Isner in the semifinals, but lost in three tough sets. His 2013 US Open (tennis) run started well, beating Brian Baker (tennis) in four sets and following up with a five-set epic upset against fellow former US Open champion Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, where Hewitt came back from two sets to one down against the No. 6, winning a fourth set tiebreak and sealing the match 6\u20131 in the fifth. He beat Evgeny Donskoy in the third round to set up a fourth round match with Mikhail Youzhny. Hewitt then lost to Youzhny 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 7\u20136, 4\u20136, 7\u20135, despite leading 4\u20131 in the fourth set and serving for the match at 5\u20133 in the fifth set. A measure of the success of Hewitts 2013 season is the fact that he won the John Newcombe as the most outstanding Australian tennis player in 2013, a year in which he returned to the worlds top 100.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many players did he defeat on his way to the first final of the Hall-Of-Fame Championships?",
