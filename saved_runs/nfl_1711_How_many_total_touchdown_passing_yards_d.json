In the first quarter Atlanta took the early lead as QB Matt Ryan completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White, followed in the second quarter by kicker Matt Bryant hitting a 24-yard field goal. Arizona would reply with RB Tim Hightower scampering 80 yards for a TD run, but Atlanta increased their lead when Ryan threw a 19-yard TD pass to FB Jason Snelling, followed by Snelling getting a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter the Falcons continued to dominate the game when Ryan completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to WR Brian Finneran, followed by Bryan nailing a 35-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter Atlanta scored once again with FB Jason Snelling getting a 7-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total touchdown passing yards did Matt Ryan throw?",
