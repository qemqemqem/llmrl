    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Steelers stayed home for a SNF duel against longtime division rival Bengals.  The first quarter was all Steelers as they scored touchdowns in 3 different ways:  Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard, Antonio Brown caught a 12-yard pass, and then returned a punt 67 yards putting up scores of 7-0, 14-0, and 21-0.  This remains the most points in their franchise history they have scored in the first quarter while it remains the largest number of points the Bengals have allowed in the first quarter alone.  This streak of points stood at 24 straight as Shaun Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal.  The Bengals finally got on the board as Gio Benard ran for a 1-yard touchdown making the score 24-7.  Suisham then nailed a 45-yard field goal to move his team ahead 27-7 at halftime.  After this, the Steelers went back to work in the 3rd quarter coming away with another field goal from 26 yards out for a 30-7 lead.  The 4th quarter however, was all Bengals as Andy Dalton and Tyler Eifert connected on a 1-yard touchdown pass making the score 30-14 not long before Dalton found Marvin Jones on a 13-yard pass making the score 30-20, but the 2-point conversion failed as the Steelers would eventually win the game with that score as the final sending them to 6-8.  Coupled with losses of the Ravens, Chargers, and Dolphins, the Steelers also remained in the playoff hunt.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
