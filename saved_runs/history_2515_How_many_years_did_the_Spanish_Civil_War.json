Other conflicts during the decade which affected the stock market included the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War, the 1935-1936 Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Soviet-Japanese Border War (1939) of 1939 and the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937. On top of that, the United States dealt with a painful recession in Recession of 1937-1938 which temporarily brought economic recovery to a halt.
