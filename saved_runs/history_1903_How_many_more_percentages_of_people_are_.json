More than 5.5 million are of European origin and about 4 million of Maghrebis origin (20% of Algerian origin and 15% of Moroccan or Tunisian origin). Immigrants aged 18 to 50 count for 2.7 million (10% of population age 18\u201350) and 5 million for all ages (8% of population). The second-generation immigrants aged 18 to 50 make up 3.1 million (12% of 18\u201350) and 6.5 million for all ages (11% of population). Without considering citizenship at birth, people not born in metropolitan France and their direct descendants made up 30% of the population aged 18\u201350 in metropolitan France as of 2008.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more percentages of people are Algerian rather than Moroccan?",
