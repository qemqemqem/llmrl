    "problem_text": "Context:\nDetermined to play competitive basketball despite being out of the NBA, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team composed of former NBA and college players.  In 1994 Johnson joined with former pros Mark Aguirre, Reggie Theus, John Long (basketball), Earl Cureton, Jim Farmer, and Lester Conner, as his team played games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan. They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the Continental Basketball Association. In the final game of the CBA series, Magic Johnson had 30 points, 17 rebounds, and 13 assists, leading the All-Stars to a 126-121 victory over the Oklahoma City Cavalry. By the time he returned to the Lakers in 1996, the Magic Johnson All-Stars had amassed a record of 55-0, and Johnson was earning as much as $365,000 per game. Johnson played with the team frequently over the next several years, with possibly the most memorable game occurring in November, 2001. Magic, at the age of 42, played with the All-Stars against his alma mater, Michigan State Spartans mens basketball. Although he played in a celebrity game to honor coach Jud Heathcoate in 1995, this was Johnsons first meaningful game played in his hometown of Lansing in 22 years. Playing in front of a sold out arena, Johnson had a triple-double and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans by two points. Johnsons half court shot at the buzzer would have won the game, but it fell short. On November 1, 2002 Johnson returned to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State. Playing with the Canberra Cannons of Australias National Basketball League (Australasia) instead of his usual group of players, Johnsons team defeated the Spartans 104-85, as he scored 12 points, with 10 assists and 10 rebounds.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more rebounds did Magic Johnson have in the final game of the CBA series than when his team defeated the Spartans?",
