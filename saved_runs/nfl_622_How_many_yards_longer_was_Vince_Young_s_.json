    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping ro rebound from their road loss to the Browns, the Texans flew to LP Field for a Week 13 AFC South rematch with the Tennessee Titans.  In the first quarter, Houston got the first punch as RB Ron Dayne got a 1-yard TD run.  The Titans would respond with RB LenDale White getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Houston regained the lead with kicker Kris Brown getting a 45-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, the Tennessee took the lead with QB Vince Young completing a 43-yard TD pass to WR Roydell Williams, along with an 11-yard TD pass to WR Justin Gage.  In the fourth quarter, the Texans tried to get a comeback as QB Sage Rosenfels completed a 28-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, yet the Titans responded with RB Chris Brown getting a 7-yard TD run.  Houston tried to come back and take the lead, but their only response was Browns' 50-yard field goal. With the loss, the Texans fell to 5-7.  They have now lost 7 out of their last 8 divisional road games. QB Matt Schaub (3/5 for 34 yards) was knocked out of the game in the first quarter with a left shoulder injury.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Vince Young's touchdown pass to Roydell Williams compared to his one to Justin Gage?",
