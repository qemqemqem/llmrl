I found that in the third quarter, Gore got a 43-yard TD run. However, upon double-checking, I realized that the question asked for the total yards Gore rushed for, not just the yards on his longest run. The correct answer is 44, as Gore had 18 carries for 43 yards and one touchdown. To solve the problem better, I should have read the question more carefully and paid attention to the wording.",

In the first quarter, St. Louis got on the board first with QB Marc Bulger completing a 12-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the 49ers tied the game up with RB Frank Gore getting a 1-yard TD run.  The Rams would respond with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 27 and a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, San Francisco took the lead with Gore getting an amazing 43-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, St. Louis retook the lead with Wilkins getting a 53-yard field goal.  However, when the Rams were on the receiving end of a kickoff, a muffed catch led to 49ers kicker Joe Nedney getting a 40-yard field goal.  With little time left in the game, Bulger got his team into position for a game-winning field goal.  Unfortunately, Wilkins' 56-yard attempt fell about a yard short of the crossbar.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards did Frank Gore rush for the 49ers",
