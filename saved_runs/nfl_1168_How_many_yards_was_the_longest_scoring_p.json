    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their home loss to the Broncos, the Jets flew to Candlestick Park for a Week 14 interconference battle with the San Francisco 49ers.  Late in the first quarter, New York trailed early as 49ers offensive tackle Joe Staley recovered Jason Hill's fumble in the endzone for a touchdown.  The Jets responded in the second quarter with quarterback Brett Favre getting a 2-yard touchdown run, yet San Francisco would answer with quarterback Shaun Hill completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back Frank Gore. In the third quarter, New York tied the game with running back Thomas Jones's 17-yard touchdown run.  However, the 49ers pulled away in the fourth quarter as kicker Joe Nedney nailed a 32-yard field goal, along with Hill completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bryant Johnson.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest scoring play of the game?",
