    "problem_text": "Context:\nWillie Parker was expected to return after missing two games, but aggravated his knee injury during a weekday practice and missed the game. Pittsburgh received the opening kickoff and drove 75&#160;yards to open the scoring with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Mewelde Moore to put the Steelers up 7-0. The Steelers' defense forced the Bengals offense into five consecutive three-and-outs, before the Bengals scored on their final possession of the opening half. The 5-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Chad Johnson brought the Bengals within three points of the Steelers, who added a field goal from Jeff Reed. Pittsburgh added their second touchdown of the game on their opening drive of the second half when Moore rushed to the left side for 13&#160;yards. Cincinnati retaliated on their ensuing drive adding a field goal from Dave Rayner. The Steelers scored three consecutive touchdowns in the final quarter, while holding the Bengals scoreless. At 8:26 of the fourth quarter Roethlisberger connected with Nate Washington for a 50-yard touchdown pass. Pittsburgh's Moore scored his third touchdown of the day&#8212;his second rushing&#8212;and Hines Ward's 16-yard touchdown reception gave the Steelers 31&#160;points to the Bengals' ten. Moore finished the game with 120&#160;yards rushing, while Santonio Holmes lead the Steelers with 89&#160;Receiving yards.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest TD pass?",
