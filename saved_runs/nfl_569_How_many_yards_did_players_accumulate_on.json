    "problem_text": "Context:\nFollowing their OT win over the Raiders, the Broncos stayed at home for an intraconference duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  After a scoreless first quarter, Denver trailed early as Jaguars QB David Garrard completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Williams.  The Broncos would tie the game with QB Jay Cutler completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Nate Jackson.  However, Jacksonville would take the lead with FB Greg Jones getting a 4-yard TD run, while kicker John Carney nailed a 19-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver continued to trail as the Jaguars increased its lead with Carney's 27-yard field goal, which was the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Broncos attempted a comeback with RB Travis Henry getting a 6-yard TD run.  However, Jacksonville sealed their win with Carney kicking an 18-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did players accumulate on all touchdown plays?",
