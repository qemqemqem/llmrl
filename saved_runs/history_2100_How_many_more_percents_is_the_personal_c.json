    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I calculated the percentage difference between personal consumption and business investment by subtracting the percentage of business investment from the percentage of personal consumption and then dividing the result by the percentage of business investment. The calculation is (70-18)/18 = 3.89, which means that personal consumption is 3.89 times the size of business investment. To convert this to a percentage, I subtracted 1 from 3.89 and multiplied the result by 100, which gave me 289%. Finally, I subtracted 100 from 289 to get the percentage difference, which is 189%. Therefore, the personal consumption of GDP is 52% more than business investment.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have used a simpler method by dividing the percentage of personal consumption by the percentage of business investment and then subtracting 1 from the result. This would have given me the percentage difference directly, which is 289% - 100% = 189%.",

About 70% of U.S. GDP is personal consumption, with business investment 18%, government 17% (federal, state and local but excluding transfer payments such as Social Security, which is in consumption) and net exports a negative 3% due to the U.S. trade deficit. Real gross domestic product, a measure of both production and income, grew by 2.3% in 2017, vs. 1.5% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015. Real GDP grew at a quarterly annualized rate of 2.2% in Q1 2018 and 4.1% in Q2 2018 under President Trump; the Q2 rate was the best growth rate since Q3 2014.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more percents is the personal consumption of GDP compared to business investment?",
