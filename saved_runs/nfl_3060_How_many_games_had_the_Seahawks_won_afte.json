    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter easily defeating the Cleveland Browns at home, the Seahawks remained at home to host the St. Louis Rams. Doug Baldwin's touchdown reception in the third quarter surpasses Daryl Turner's mark set in 1985 for the most receiving touchdowns by a Seahawk in a single season with 14. With the loss, the Seahawks drop to 9-6, snapping a five-game winning streak. The Rams have swept the season series for the first time since 2004. This marks the first time in 71 games (including postseason) the Seahawks have not held the lead at any point during the game. This is also the first such instance during the Wilson era. Prior to this game, the Seahawks have held the lead at least once during the game for an NFL-record 70 consecutive games (including postseason). Additionally, the Seahawks' 25-game streak of having 100 rushing yards as a team (another NFL record) came to an end.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many games had the Seahawks won after this one?",
