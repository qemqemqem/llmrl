    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn order to keep their season alive, the Panthers were in need of a win against the Bears to qualify for their first 2-2 or above start since 2008. Cam Newton threw for another 374 pass yards, which would be the highest total he would end up throwing for the rest of the season. Things started rough for the Panthers when Newton threw a pass to D.J. Moore which was taken back the other way for a Chicago Bears touchdown which put the Bears up, 10-3. Panthers now trailing 17-10, on a 4th and 5, forced to punt, Devin Hester beats out the Panthers special teams' for a 69-yard punt return, which would break the NFL record for punt return touchdowns (11). At halftime, the Panthers were trailing 24-20. The third quarter was scoreless. But in the fourth quarter, with 14:17 remaining on the game clock, Jay Cutler threw a pass to Charles Godfrey for an interception which they would get a field goal out of. With 1:55 left on the game clock, Panthers trailing by 1, 23-24, on a fourth-and-10 at their own 42, Cam Newton threw a deep pass to Legedu Naanee which was incomplete. Matt Forte basically sealed the deal on the very next play from the Bears' 43 when he ran for 40 yards down to the Panthers' 3. The Bears would punch it in and would go on to win the game, 34-29. For the first time in his career, Cam Newton was nominated for the Pepsi Rookie Of The Week awards. With the loss, the Panthers fell to 1-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many career punt returns for touchdowns does Hester have?",
