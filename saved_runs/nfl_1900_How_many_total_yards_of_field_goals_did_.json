    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing out of their bye week the Chiefs flew to Lucas Oil Stadium for an AFC duel with the Colts. In the first quarter the Chiefs trailed early as kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 20-yard field goal, followed by a 24-yard field goal in the second quarter. The Chiefs replied with kicker Ryan Succop nailing a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Colts increased their lead with Vinatieri's 47-yard field goal, followed by Succop's 35 and 43-yard field goals to tie the game. In the fourth quarter the Chiefs trailed slightly with Vinatieri getting a 42-yard field goal. After that, the Chiefs defense was finally broken down with RB Mike Hart getting an 11-yard TD run. With the loss, the Chiefs fell to 3-1 and it also marked the first time since 1970 where no teams start out 4-0.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards of field goals did Adam Vinatieri make?",
