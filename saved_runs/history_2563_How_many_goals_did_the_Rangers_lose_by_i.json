    "problem_text": "Context:\nJagr broke the Rangers single-season points record with a first-period assist in a 5\u20131 win against the New York Islanders on March 29, 2006. The assist gave him 110 points on the season, breaking Jean Ratelles record. Less than two weeks later, on April 8, Jagr scored his 53rd goal of the season against the Boston Bruins, breaking the club record previously held by Adam Graves. Two games prior, on April 4, the Rangers defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 3\u20132, in a shootout, to clinch a playoff spot for the first time since the 1996\u201397 NHL season. On April 18, the Rangers lost to the Ottawa Senators 5\u20131, and, due to wins by Division rivals New Jersey and Philadelphia, the Rangers fell back to third place in the Atlantic division and sixth place in the Eastern Conference (NHL) to end the season. In the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Rangers drew a matchup with the Devils and were defeated in a four-game sweep. In the process, they were outscored 17\u20134, as New Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur took two shutouts and a 1.00 GAA to Lundqvists 4.25. In Game 1 of the series, Jagr suffered an undisclosed injury to his left shoulder, diminishing his usefulness as the series progressed. He missed Game 2 and was back in the lineup for Game 3, though he was held to just one shot on goal. However, on his first shift of Game 4, Jagr re-injured his shoulder and was unable to return for the remainder of the game. Jagr fell two points short of winning his sixth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion in 2005\u201306 (the San Jose Sharks Joe Thornton claimed the award, his first, with 125 points), but Jagr did win his third Ted Lindsay Award as the players choice for the most outstanding player.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many goals did the Rangers lose by in the April 18 game with Ottawa?",
