    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their season-sweeping road win over the Giants, the Cowboys went home for a Week 11 NFC East duel with the Washington Redskins, a longtime rival of the Cowboys.  In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early as Redskins QB Jason Campbell completed a 19-yard TD pass to TE Chris Cooley for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the 'Boys got on the board as QB Tony Romo completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Washington would take the lead into halftime as kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Cowboys took the lead with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 31-yard TD pass.  The Redskins got close as Suisham kicked a 39-yard field goal.  Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, the 'Boys started to run away with the lead as Romo and Owens hooked up with each other for a third time on a 46-yard TD pass.  Washington tried to come back as Suisham nailed a 44-yard field goal, yet Dallas continued to roll as Romo hooked up with Owens for the fourth time on a 52-yard TD pass.  The Redskins tried to come back as Campbell completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss.  Fortunately, the Dallas defense held on for the victory. Terrell Owens, with his 4 touchdown receptions, tied Bob Hayes for the most touchdown receptions by a Cowboys receiver in one game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Suisham kick?",
