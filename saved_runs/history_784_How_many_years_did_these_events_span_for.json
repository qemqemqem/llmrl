    "problem_text": "Context:\nSteps were taken to prevent future rebellions; William Roy completed the first comprehensive survey of the Highlands, new forts built and the network of military roads started by Wade after 1715 finally completed. Additional measures were taken to undermine the traditional clan system, which had been under severe stress even before 1745 due to changing economic conditions. The Heritable Jurisdictions Act ended the traditional powers exercised by chiefs over their clansmen while the Act of Proscription outlawed Highland dress unless worn in military service. This Act was repealed in 1782, by which time its purpose had been achieved. The Jacobite cause did not entirely disappear after 1746 but the exposure of the key factions' conflicting objectives ended it as a serious threat. Many Scots were disillusioned by Charles' leadership while areas in England that were strongly Jacobite in 1715 like Northumberland and County Durham provided minimal support in 1745. Irish Jacobite societies continued but increasingly reflected opposition to the existing order rather than affection for the Stuarts and were absorbed by the Republican United Irishmen.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years did these events span for?",
