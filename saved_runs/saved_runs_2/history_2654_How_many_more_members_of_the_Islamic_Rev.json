    "problem_text": "Context:\nAccording to Iranian government sources, the war cost Iran an estimated 200,000\u2013220,000 killed, or up to 262,000 according to the conservative Western estimates. This includes 123,220 combatants, 60,711 Missing in action and 11,000\u201316,000 Civilian casualties. Combatants include 79,664 members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and additional 35,170 soldiers from Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In addition, prisoners of war comprise 42,875 Iranian casualties, they were captured and kept in Iraqi detention centers from 2.5 to more than 15 years after the war was over. According to the Janbazan Affairs Organization, 398,587 Iranians sustained injuries that required prolonged medical and health care following primary treatment, including 52,195 (13%) injured due to the exposure to chemical warfare agents. From 1980 to 2012, 218,867 Iranians died due to war injuries and the mean age of combatants was 23 years old. This includes 33,430 civilians, mostly women and children. More than 144,000 Iranian children were orphaned as a consequence of these deaths. Other estimates put Iranian casualties up to 600,000.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were there in the count of combatants compared to the number of soldiers from Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran?",
