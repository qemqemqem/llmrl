    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their home loss to the Broncos, the Titans flew to Cowboys Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.  Tennessee delivered the opening punch in the first quarter as quarterback Vince Young completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Nate Washington, followed by kicker Rob Bironas making a 52-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Cowboys answered with kicker David Buehler getting a 51-field goal.  In the second quarter, the Titans would add onto their lead as Young connected with wide receiver Kenny Britt on a 12-yard touchdown pass.  Dallas came right back with quarterback Tony Romo completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roy Williams. The Cowboys tied the game in the third quarter as Romo threw a 69-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Miles Austin, yet Tennessee regained the lead as Bironas booted a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas caught up again as Buehler kicked a 26-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Titans struck back as running back Chris Johnson got a 1-yard touchdown run.  However, the Cowboys would tie the game again as Romo connected with tight end Jason Witten on an 18-yard touchdown pass.  Fortunately, Tennessee came right back as Johnson got another 1-yard touchdown run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the differential between the longest field goal and the shortest field goal?",
