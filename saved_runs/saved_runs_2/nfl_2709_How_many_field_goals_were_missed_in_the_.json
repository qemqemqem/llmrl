    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Bills' defense dominated the Browns in a 26-10 defeat.  The first half was low scoring; K Billy Cundiff made a 22-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  Several special teams errors occurred in the second quarter that prevented either team from scoring.  Cundiff missed a field goal and the Bills' K Dan Carpenter's 53 yard field goal try was blocked by S Joe Haden. The Bills dominated the second half, scoring 20 unanswered points to seize control.  The Bills scored a touchdown early in the third to go up 7-3. On the Browns' next drive, RB Terrance West fumbled, and the Bills recovered for a touchdown, adding a field goal in the 4th quarter to make it 17-3.  Hoyer threw an INT on the next drive, and the Bills kicked another field goal, building a 20-3 lead.  At that moment, Hoyer was benched for Johnny Manziel for the remainder of the game.  Manziel led an 80-yard touchdown drive on his first series, running for a touchdown to cut the deficit to 20-10. On Manziel's second drive, the Browns failed to gain a first down, turning the ball over on downs.  The Bills kicked 2 more field goals to make it 26-10, producing the final margin. With the loss, the Browns fell to 7-5, still in 4th place in the AFC North (due to tiebreakers). For Hoyer, this was the second consecutive game where he had 0 passing touchdowns and multiple interceptions. It was the Browns' first loss this season when holding a lead after the first half. The 26 points allowed by the Browns in the second half were the most points that they had surrendered in the second half of any game this season. Following the game, Browns coach Mike Pettine announced that he was uncertain who would start at QB against the Indianapolis Colts, but he would decide by Wednesday. WR Miles Austin was hospitalized at the end of the game for a kidney injury sustained from a helmet-leading tackle in the 2nd quarter. He was later ruled out for the remainder of the season.  On December 3, Pettine announced that Hoyer would start against the Colts.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were missed in the second quarter?",
