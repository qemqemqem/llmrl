    "problem_text": "Context:\nOn 23 February 1915, a Court of Inquiry was held, at first meeting in confidence but then in public sessions. It prepared a 450-page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, the cause of the mutiny was not conclusively established. The focus of the report was on possible external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the mutiny. More than 205\u00a0sepoys were tried by court-martial, and 47\u00a0were publicly executed, including Kassim Mansoor. Most soldiers killed were Muslims from the Hisar district and Rohtak district of current Haryana state of India. Nur Alam Shah was not put on trial, although he was exposed as an active Indian nationalist with links to Ghadar. Instead, he was detained and deported, as the British did not want to stir up trouble among their Muslim subjects. Sixty-four mutineers were transported for life, and 73 were given terms of imprisonment ranging from 7 to 20\u00a0years. The public executions by firing squad took place at Outram Prison, and were witnessed by an estimated 15,000\u00a0people. The Straits Times reported:\n\nQuestion:\nWhich happened first, Kassim Mansoor's execution or Nur Alam Shah's deportation?",
