Chicago delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter with a 46-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould.  The Bears added onto their lead in the second quarter with Gould's 24-yard field goal. Chicago went back to work in the third quarter as Gould booted a 50-yard field goal, followed by a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Matt Fort&#233;.  As they had done all game, the Bears defense continued to stifle any offensive production by the Dolphins, thus completing the shutout, the first shutout recorded by the Bears since 2006. As of 2016, this remains the final shutout by the team. With the win, not only did the Bears improve to 7-3, but they also won their 700th game in franchise history (the first NFL team to do so). Ironically, 25 years prior, the Bears lost to the Dolphins, with the score of the 2010 matchup being the record the 1985 team was vying for had they been able to defeat the Dolphins.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
