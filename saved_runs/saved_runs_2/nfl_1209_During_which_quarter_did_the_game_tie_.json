A Steelers 42-yard flea flicker advanced the ball to the 2&#160;yard line. On the following play Mewelde Moore scored his second touchdown of the game. The Steelers extended their lead to ten, but an interception with 1:30 remaining in the half led to a Colts touchdown&#8212;bringing the halftime score to 17-14. The Colts kicked a 36-yard field goal in the third quarter to tie the game at 17. A Steelers field goal in the final quarter gave them a three-point lead. The Colts scored on Peyton Manning's third touchdown pass of the game to take the lead with 3:10 remaining in regulation. The Steelers drove from their own 27&#160;yard line to the Colts' 27 yard line, but a 4th down Hail Mary attempt from Roethlisberger was intercepted in the end zone as time expired.\n\nQuestion:\nDuring which quarter did the game tie?",
