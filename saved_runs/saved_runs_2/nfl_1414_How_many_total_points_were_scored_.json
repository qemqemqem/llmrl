The Browns struck first with a 17-yard run by Jerome Harrison and a 42-yard field goal from Phil Dawson. Oakland kicker Sebastian Janikowski hit 3 field goals in the first half, including a 61 yarder to close out the half. However, the Browns led at halftime, 17-9. The Browns held the Raiders scoreless in the second half, and Dawson hit 2 more field goals to lead the Browns to a 23-9 victory, their third in a row.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total points were scored?",
