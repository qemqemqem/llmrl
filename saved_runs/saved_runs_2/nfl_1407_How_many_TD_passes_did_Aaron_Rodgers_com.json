After a scoreless first quarter, Cleveland began the second quarter with kicker Billy Cundiff's 22-yard field goal. However, the Packers would take charge with quarterback Aaron Rodgers completing a 45-yard touchdown pass to tight end Spencer Havner and a 71-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver, followed by a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Ryan Grant. Afterwards, Green Bay pulled away in the second half with kicker Mason Crosby booting an 18-yard field goal in the third quarter and Rodgers finding wide receiver James Jones on a 5-yard touchdown pass.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many TD passes did Aaron Rodgers complete?",
