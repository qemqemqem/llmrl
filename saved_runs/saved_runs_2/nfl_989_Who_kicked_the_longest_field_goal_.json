Chicago immediately got the lead as free safety Danieal Manning returned the game's opening kickoff 83 yards for a touchdown.  The Saints would respond in the second quarter with quarterback Drew Brees compleing a 2-yard touchdown pass to running back Pierre Thomas, yet the Bears answered with rookie running back Matt Fort&#233; getting a 1-yard touchdown run, while quarterback Kyle Orton got a 6-yard touchdown run. New Orleans would begin to rally in the third quarter as Thomas got a 42-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, the Sains took the lead as kicker Garrett Hartley made a 30-yard field goal, along with Brees completing an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marques Colston.  Afterwards, Chicago replied with a game-tying 28-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould.  In overtime, the Bears clinched the victory as Gould nailed the game-winning 35-yard field goal. With the win, Chicago kept its playoff hopes alive by improving to 8-6.\n\nQuestion:\nWho kicked the longest field goal?",
