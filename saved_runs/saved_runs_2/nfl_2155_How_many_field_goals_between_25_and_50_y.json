(The game was jokingly nicknamed \"The Harbaugh Bowl.\") Baltimore delivered the game's opening punch in the first quarter with a 39-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff, but the 49ers answered with kicker David Akers getting a 45-yard field goal.  The Ravens regained the lead in the second quarter with a 23-yard field goal from Cundiff. San Francisco began the third quarter with Akers nailing a 52-yard field goal, yet Baltimore regained the lead in the fourth quarter with quarterback Joe Flacco finding tight end Dennis Pitta on an 8-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 39-yard field goal from Cundiff.  Afterwards, the defense would hold to prevent any comeback attempt from the 49ers. Linebacker Terrell Suggs (3 tackles, 3 sacks, & 1 forced fumble) was named NFL Network's Puddin' Pie Award winner.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals between 25 and 50 yards were made?",
