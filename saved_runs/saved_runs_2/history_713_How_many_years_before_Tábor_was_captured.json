    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Utraquist creed, frequently varying in its details, continued to be that of the established church of Bohemia until all non-Catholic religious services were prohibited shortly after the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620. The Taborite party never recovered from its defeat at Lipany, and after the town of T\u00e1bor had been captured by George of Pod\u011bbrady in 1452, Utraquist religious worship was established there. The Bohemian Brethren , whose intellectual originator was Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd but whose actual founders were Brother Gregory, a nephew of Archbishop Rokycany, and Michael, curate of \u017damberk, to a certain extent continued the Taborite traditions, and in the 15th and 16th centuries included most of the strongest opponents of Rome in Bohemia. J. A. Komensk\u00fd , a member of the Brethren, claimed for the members of his church that they were the genuine inheritors of the doctrines of Hus. After the beginning of the German Reformation, many Utraquists adopted to a large extent the doctrines of Martin Luther and of John Calvin and, in 1567, obtained the repeal of the Compacts which no longer seemed sufficiently far-reaching. From the end of the 16th century the inheritors of the Hussite tradition in Bohemia were included in the more general name of \"Protestants\" borne by the adherents of the Reformation. At the end of the Hussite Wars in 1431, the lands of Bohemia had been totally ravaged. The  adjacent Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany was left in such bad shape after the Hussite Wars, that the impoverishment of the people was still evident in 1476. The poor conditions contributed directly to the peasant conspiracy that broke out that same year in W\u00fcrzburg.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years before T\u00e1bor was captured by George did the  Hussite Wars start?",
