    "problem_text": "Context:\nNext, the Lions stayed at home for a Week 14 NFC North rematch with newly signed veteran quarterback Daunte Culpepper's former team, the Minnesota Vikings.  In the first quarter, Detroit was on the board first as kicker Jason Hanson got a 25-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Lions increased their lead as Hanson got a 23-yard field goal. The Vikings would close out the half as kicker Ryan Longwell got a 35-yard field goal. During the first half, Moran Norris was ejected by referee Jerome Boger for throwing a punch at Minnesota's Napoleon Harris. In the third quarter, Minnesota took the lead as RB Chester Taylor got a 17-yard TD run. Detroit would respond with former Vikings QB Daunte Culpepper completing a 70-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. However, Minnesota got the lead again as QB Tarvaris Jackson completed an 11-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe.  In the fourth quarter, the Lions tried to rally as Hanson made a 39-yard field goal.  However, the Vikings pulled away as Longwell nailed a 50-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards combined are the top two longest field goals?",
