To solve the problem, I reviewed the game summary and identified the two plays in which Jahvid Best scored touchdowns. He had a 14-yard touchdown run and a 75-yard touchdown catch. Adding these two yardages together, we get a total of 89 yards. However, the correct answer is 91 yards, as the 75-yard touchdown catch should be added to the 2 yards gained on the 2-yard touchdown run. To solve the problem better, I could have double-checked my calculations to ensure accuracy.",

The Eagles scored first midway through the first quarter with a 45-yard touchdown catch by DeSean Jackson. The Lions responded a few minutes later with a 14-yard touchdown run by Jahvid Best. Later in the second quarter the Lions broke the tie with a 49-yard Jason Hanson field goal. They increased their lead with a 75-yard touchdown catch by Jahvid Best. The Eagles answered with 4 consecutive touchdowns. First a 14-yard run by LeSean McCoy. Next a 9-yard run by Jeremy Maclin just before halftime. Midway through the third, Philadelphia added to their lead with 2 touchdowns by LeSean McCoy. First a 4-yard run, then in the 4th quarter one for 46 yards. The Lions then attempted a comeback with 2 consecutive touchdowns late in the game. First a 2-yard touchdown run by Jahvid Best. Then a 19-yard catch by Calvin Johnson with a 2-point conversion tacked on. The Lions completed an onside kick but turned the ball over on downs. With the loss, the Lions fell to 0-2 for the 3rd straight season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did Jahvid Best have in touchdown scoring plays?",
