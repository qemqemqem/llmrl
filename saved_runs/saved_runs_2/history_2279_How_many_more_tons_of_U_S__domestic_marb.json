Crushed marble production (for aggregate and industrial uses) in 2006 was 11.8 million tons valued at $116 million, of which 6.5 million tons was finely ground calcium carbonate and the rest was construction aggregate. For comparison, 2005 crushed marble production was 7.76 million tons valued at $58.7 million, of which 4.8 million tons was finely ground calcium carbonate and the rest was construction aggregate. U.S. dimension marble demand is about 1.3 million tons. The DSAN World Demand for (finished) Marble Index has shown a growth of 12% annually for the 2000\u20132006 period, compared to 10.5% annually for the 2000\u20132005 period. The largest dimension marble application is tile.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more tons of U.S. domestic marble was produced in 2005 compared to 2006?",
