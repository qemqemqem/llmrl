    "commentary_on_process": "I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I misunderstood the question and only added up the total yards of field goals made by Rob Bironas. To find the total yards of field goals made by both kickers, I need to add up the yards of field goals made by David Akers and Rob Bironas. From the given context, we know that David Akers made field goals of 25, 46, and 28 yards, while Rob Bironas made field goals of 41 and 38 yards. Therefore, the total yards of field goals made by both kickers is:\n\n25 + 46 + 28 + 41 + 38 = 178 yards\n\nSo, the correct answer is 178. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully and identified all the relevant information before attempting to solve it.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to increase their winning streak the Eagles flew to LP Field for an Interconference duel with the Titans. In the second quarter the Eagles took the lead with kicker David Akers making a 25-yard field goal. But they trailed when QB Kerry Collins completed a 26-yard TD pass to WR Kenny Britt. The Eagles replied with QB Kevin Kolb making a 5-yard TD pass to WR Riley Cooper, followed by kicker David Akers hitting a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Eagles increased their lead with Akers making a 46-yard field goal. The Titans answered with kicker Rob Bironas nailing a 41-yard field goal, but the Eagles continued to score in the 4th with Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal. Eventually, they fell behind with Collins completing an 80-yard TD pass to Britt, followed by Bironas hitting a 38-yard field goal. Collins found Britt for the third time in the game on a 16-yard TD pass, and then Bironas made a 33-yard field goal. The Eagles had more problems when Kolb's pass was intercepted by CB Cortland Finnegan and returned 41 yards for a touchdown. With the loss, the Eagles went into their bye week at 4-3. Andy Reid announced that Michael Vick would regain the starting quarterback position after the bye week, effectively ending any quarterback controversy\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total yards of field goals did Rob Bironas make?",
