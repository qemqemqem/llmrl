    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Raiders stayed home for a game against the Cardinals.  The Cardinals scored first in the first quarter when Carson Palmer found Stepfan Taylor on a 2-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead and the only score of the quarter.  They made it 14-0 in the 2nd quarter when Palmer found Michael Floyd on a 33-yard touchdown pass.  The Raiders got on the board when Darren McFadden ran for a 1-yard touchdown for a 14-7 lead followed up by Sebastian Janikowski kicking a 29-yard field goal for a 14-10 game at halftime.  In the 3rd quarter, the Raiders came within 1 as Janikowski managed to kick a 53-yard field goal for a 14-13 game.  The Cards however took control of the game as Taylor ran for a 4-yard touchdown for a 21-13 lead.  Finally in the 4th quarter the Cards wrapped up the scoring when Chandler Catanzaro nailed a 41-yard field goal for the eventual final score of 24-13. With the loss, the Raiders dropped to 0-6 and with the Jaguars' win over the Browns, they became the league's only winless team.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards were the two shorest field goals in the game?",
