    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Eagles, the Redskins traveled to Texas Stadium for a Week 11 NFC East showdown with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, the Redskins struck first when quarterback Jason Campbell completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Chris Cooley for the only score in the quarter. In the second quarter, the Cowboys tied the game with quarterback Tony Romo completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens. Afterwards, the Redskins would take the lead into halftime as kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Cowboys took the lead as Romo hooked up with Owens again for a 31-yard touchdown pass. the Redskins' response would be Suisham kicking a 39-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys added onto their lead as Romo and Owens hooked up for a third time on a 46-yard touchdown pass, the Redskins' answer; Suisham kicking a 44-yard field goal. Unfortunately for the Redskins, the Cowboys managed to put the game out of reach with Romo and Owens hooking up for the fourth time on a 52-yard touchdown pass. The Redskins' only response would Campbell's 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santana Moss.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player threw more touchdown passes over 15 yards, Tony Romo or Jason Campbell?",
