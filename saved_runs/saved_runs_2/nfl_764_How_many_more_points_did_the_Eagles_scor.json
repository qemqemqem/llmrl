    "problem_text": "Context:\nPlaying their home opener on Monday Night Football, the Eagles lost to a 20-12 decision to the Washington Redskins. A long reception by Santana Moss led to a first-quarter field goal for the Redskins. The Eagles responded with a pair of David Akers field goals in the second quarter to take a 6-3 lead. With nine seconds remaining in the half, Washington quarterback Jason Campbell passed to Chris Cooley in the end zone for a touchdown and Redskin lead. The teams traded field goals in the third quarter, and Clinton Portis rushed for a six-yard touchdown early in the final quarter to make it 20-9. Donovan McNabb drove the Eagles to a field goal to bring them within eight points. On their last series, the Eagles got to the Washington nine-yard line, but the drive stalled there, preserving the Redskin victory. McNabb threw for 240 yards, Brian Westbrook had 162 all-purpose yards, and Akers connected on four field goals. This game you can say, ultimately cost the eagles the playoffs. They finished one game behind the redskins for the 6th and final playoff spot. It's also the first time since 2003 that the  Eagles dropped their first two games.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more points did the Eagles score than the Redskins?",
