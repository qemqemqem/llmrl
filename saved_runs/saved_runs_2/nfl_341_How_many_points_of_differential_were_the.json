In a stark contrast to the come-from-behind victory against Denver earlier in the season, San Diego scored early and often in this game, leading the game 28-3 at halftime. It was all Denver in the 3rd quarter, the Broncos closing the gap to 28-20, but San Diego bounced back in the fourth quarter with 20 unanswered points, winning the game 48-20. The win, as well as a Kansas City Chiefs loss earlier in the day, clinched the AFC West Division for San Diego. With the Indianapolis Colts also losing earlier in the day, San Diego gained the best record in the AFC (11-2). In addition, with his 7-yard rushing touchdown toward the end of the 4th quarter (his third of the game), RB LaDainian Tomlinson broke the NFL single-season touchdown record (29) (26 Rushing, 3 receiving), set by the Seattle Seahawks' RB Shaun Alexander (28) in the previous season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points of differential were there between the two teams at the end of the game?",
