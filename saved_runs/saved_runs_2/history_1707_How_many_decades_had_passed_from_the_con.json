The text states that the railway was built in the 1950s and the highway was built in the 1960s. To determine how many decades had passed between the two events, I subtracted the year of the railway's construction from the year of the highway's construction and divided the result by 10. This gave me the answer of 1 decade.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have been more precise in my calculations by identifying the exact year of the railway's construction and the exact year of the highway's construction, rather than relying on the approximate time periods mentioned in the text.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nUntil the mid-20th century most of Yucat\u00e1n's contact with the outside world was by sea; trade with the US and Cuba, as well as Europe and other Caribbean islands, was more significant than that with the rest of Mexico. In the 1950s Yucat\u00e1n was linked to the rest of Mexico by railway, followed by highway in the 1960s, ending the region's comparative isolation. Today Yucat\u00e1n still demonstrates a unique culture from the rest of Mexico, including its own style of food. Commercial jet airplanes began arriving in M\u00e9rida in the 1960s, and additional international airports were built first in Cozumel and then in the new planned resort community of Canc\u00fan in the 1980s, making tourism a major force in the economy of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The first Maya governor of Yucat\u00e1n, Francisco Luna Kan, was elected in 1976. Today, the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is a major tourism destination, as well as home to one of the largest indigenous populations in Mexico, the Maya people.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many decades had passed from the construction of the railway to the construction of the highway in Yucatan?",
