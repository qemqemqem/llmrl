To solve the problem, I made a table to organize the given information and then looked for the natural water sources that had a cumulative discharge of over 20,000 million cubic meters. From the table, I can see that all four natural water sources had a cumulative discharge of over 20,000 million cubic meters in 2005. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have calculated the total discharge of all the natural water sources and then identified the ones with a cumulative discharge of over 20,000 million cubic meters.
