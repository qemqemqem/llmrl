Therefore, the yardage gained by Clinton Portis on each of his rushing touchdowns was 1 yard. Adding up the yardage gained on both rushing touchdowns, we get the total number of yards gained by Clinton Portis on his rushing touchdowns, which is 2 yards. \n\nSince the context explicitly mentioned that Clinton Portis had two 1-yard rushing touchdowns, the answer was straightforward.

In the 1st quarter the Redskins scored first as kicker Graham Gano got a 41 and a 27-yard field goal. In the second quarter the Redskins fell behind with QB Matt Schaub completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Jacoby Jones, but got the lead back when RB Clinton Portis got two 1-yard TD runs to put the Redskins up 20-7. The Texans tried to cut the lead in the third quarter as kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 47-yard field goal, but the Redskins increased their lead with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 22-yard TD pass to TE Chris Cooley. The Texans went on a scoring rally to tie the game when QB Matt Schaub made a 6-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter, followed in the 4th quarter by Rackers making a 43-yard field goal. Then Schaub threw a 34-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson. The decision was made when Rackers booted a 35-yard field goal in overtime to give the Redskins a loss.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did Clinton Portis have on rushing touchdowns?",
