The Cardinals (6-1) had a goal-line stand that forced the Eagles (5-2) to settle for a 20-yard field goal that put Philadelphia up 20-17 with 1:56 left.Then on third-and-five, Palmer - who also had an 80-yard TD pass to Larry Fitzgerald - heaved the ball deep, where the speedy Brown gathered it in and crossed the goal line just as he was being tackled.The Eagles drove to the Arizona 16. On the last play of the game, Jordan Matthews caught a pass from Nick Foles in the end zone but landed out of bounds.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown pass?",
