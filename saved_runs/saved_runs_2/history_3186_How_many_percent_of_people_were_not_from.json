First, I would have calculated the percentage of people who are from 2 or more races by adding the percentages of individuals from Multiracial American and Pacific Islander American groups, which is 3.1% + 0% = 3.1%. Then, I would have subtracted this percentage from 100% to find the percentage of people who are not from 2 or more races, which is 100% - 3.1% = 96.9%. \n\nTo avoid making similar mistakes in the future, I should double-check my calculations and ensure that I am using the correct information from the problem.",
