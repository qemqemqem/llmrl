Duke Theobald I's brother Matthew II, who succeeded in Lorraine, made peace and swore fealty to Blanche.  Bishop William of Langres was elected archbishop of Reims in 1219, resulting in his fortuitous departure from the conflict.  Erard renounced any claim on Champagne on 2 November 1221 and Philippa in April 1222.  In return for renouncing his claims, Erard received a substantial cash settlement.  The last rebel baron, Erard II of Chacernay, swore his renewed loyalty to Theobald IV in March 1222.  Two months later in May 1222, Theobald IV reached the age of maturity and began his reign as count, and the triumphant Countess-Regent Blanche withdrew to the Cistercian convent of Argensolles for her retirement.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years older was Theobald IV of Champagne than Lorraine's widow, Gertrude of Dagsburg?",
