In the first quarter, Houston trailed early as Falcons kicker Morten Andersen nailed a 28-yard field goal.  The Texans managed to take the lead with Schaub completing a 35-yard TD pass to WR Andr&#233; Davis.  However, Atlanta regained the lead with QB Joey Harrington completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins  In the second quarter, Houston's current woes continued with Harrington and Jenkins hooking up with each other again as 7-yard TD pass, along with Andersen kicking a 22-yard field goal.  The Texans got their only score of the period with kicker Kris Brown nailing a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston kept closer with a 37-yard field goal, but the Falcons eventually responded with Andersen kicking a 36-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Texans again crept closer with Brown getting a 19-yard field.  Yet again, Atlanta replied with Andersen kicking a 46-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Falcons held on to get their first win of the year.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is the quarterback of the Texans?",
