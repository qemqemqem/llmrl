Tennessee delivered the opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback Vince Young found wide receiver Kenny Britt on a 24-yard touchdown pass.  In the second quarter, the Titans added onto their lead as quarterback Kerry Collins hooked up with tight end Bo Scaife on a 2-yard touchdown pass, followed by kicker Rob Bironas booting a 26-yard field goal. Tennessee would continue its dominating night in the third quarter as Bironas nailed a 33-yard field goal.  The Jaguars would finally answer with a 33-yard field goal from kicker Josh Scobee.  The Titans would pull away in the fourth quarter as Bironas booted a 36-yard field goal, capped off by a 35-yard touchdown run from running back Chris Johnson.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player scored the first points of the game?",
