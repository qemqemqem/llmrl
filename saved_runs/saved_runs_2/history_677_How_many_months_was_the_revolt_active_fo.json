    "problem_text": "Context:\nAthanasius had returned to Albania by the summer of 1596 and stayed in Himara. A contemporary source stated that there were 10,000 fighters in red costumes in Himara. The revolt was active in July and August, with initial success, the rebels managing to control the coastal towns. The rebel force being reinforced by a small unit of Spaniards attacked the nearby Ottoman fort of Cerna. The fort was simultaneously attacked from three directions by 1,300 men, of whom only 300 were equipped with arquebuses. Initially a group of 100 Spaniards managed to capture part of the fort raising their flag, killing 80 Ottoman soldiers among whom the commander of the fort. However the Himariotes being confused about this turn of the battle withdrew from the battlefield. This gave the opportunity to the Ottomans to launch a successful counterattack. The revolt was easily suppressed after the Venetians convinced some of the chieftains not to join the rebellion, and the fact that the rebel army was undisciplined.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many months was the revolt active for?",
