    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to make it three straight the Chargers flew to Paul Brown Stadium for an AFC duel with the Bengals. In the first quarter the Chargers trailed early with QB Carson Palmer throwing a 3-yard TD pass to TE Jermaine Gresham. Then Palmer found WR Jerome Simpson on a 10-yard TD pass (PAT failed, wide left). The Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding hitting a 20-yard field goal, followed by RB Ryan Mathews getting a 23-yard TD run, but went into more trouble as Palmer completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Jordan Shipley. The Chargers cut the lead with Kaeding making a 28-yard field goal, but struggled to hold on after Palmer connected to Simpson on a 59-yard TD pass, followed by RB Bernard Scott getting a 10-yard TD run. The Chargers tried to come back after QB Philip Rivers made a 5-yard TD pass to WR Kelley Washington, but the Bengals defense prevented any more scoring chances. With the loss, the Chargers fell to 8-7. With Kansas City winning earlier in the day, the loss prevented the Chargers from making their sixth playoff appearance in seven years.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many 3-yard touchdown passes did Carson Palmer throw?",
