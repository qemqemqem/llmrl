The problem asked for the player who scored the shortest touchdown reception, which was not explicitly stated in the summary. However, I noticed that the summary only mentioned one touchdown reception by the Lions, which was a 46-yard catch by Calvin Johnson. Therefore, the answer must be 0, as no player scored a shorter touchdown reception. \n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have read the question more carefully and paid closer attention to the wording. The question specifically asked for the shortest touchdown reception, which means I should have been looking for a touchdown reception that was shorter than 46 yards.
