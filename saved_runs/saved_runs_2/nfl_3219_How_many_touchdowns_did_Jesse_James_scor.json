    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter a horrifying road loss, the Steelers returned home for a Sunday Night duel against the Chiefs. Through the first half, it was all Steelers starting in the first quarter when Ben Roethlisberger found Darrius Heyward-Bey on a 31-yard touchdown pass with a successful two-point conversion to make it 8-0. This was followed up with Roethlisberger finding Antonio Brown on 2 consecutive touchdown passes: from 4 and 38 yards out to make the score 22-0. In the second quarter, they made the halftime score 29-0 when Roethlisberger found Jesse James on a 9-yard touchdown pass. In the third quarter, Markus Wheaton caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to make the score 36-0. In the fourth quarter, the Chiefs finally got on the board when Alex Smith found Tyreek Hill on a 10-yard touchdown pass to make it 36-7. Though the Steelers pretty much sealed the game when De'Angelo Williams ran for a 2-yard touchdown to make it 43-7. The Chiefs then wrapped up the scoring of the game when Smith found Travis Kelce on a 3-yard touchdown pass to make the final score 43-14. With the win, the Steelers improved to 3-1. With the Ravens' loss to the Raiders earlier in the day, they move into a tie at the top of the AFC North. The Steelers set a franchise record with 22 total points scored in the first quarter. The team also snapped their streak of consecutive games with at least a giveaway. Roethlisberger who had thrown 6 touchdown passes and 4 interceptions through the first 3 games had thrown 5 touchdown passes and no interceptions in this game alone.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Jesse James score?",
