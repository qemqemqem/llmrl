    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn week seven, the Packers traveled to Cleveland, Ohio to face the 1-5 Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Browns Stadium. The Browns started off the contest with the ball at their own 45-yard line after Packers kicker Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds on the opening kickoff. The Browns couldn't manage to move the ball effectively on their first possession though failing to convert their first third down of the game and had to settle for a punt. After the punt the Packers took over at their own 14-yard line and ran the ball on ten of the eleven plays of their first drive, moving the ball all the way down to the Cleveland 32-yard line where backup running back Brandon Jackson came up a yard short on a third and three. The Packers offense stayed on the field and quarterback Aaron Rodgers attempted a quarterback sneak up the middle but the attempt failed to gain any yards and the ball was turned over on downs. Cleveland's second drive of the game was more successful than the previous, with the biggest gain of the drive coming on a 22-yard pass from quarterback Derek Anderson to wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi who beat Packers cornerback Al Harris on a square in route. Harris also grabbed Massaquoi's face mask on the tackle and the Packers were penalized 15 yards for the infraction. The Browns managed to advance the ball down deep into the red zone, but the Packers defense held the Browns out of the end zone and forced them to settle for a 22-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter that hit the upright but deflected through to give the Browns an early 3-0 lead. On the Packers' next drive, Aaron Rodgers and company moved the ball down to the Cleveland 48-yard line with a short pass to Donald Lee, a 13-yard pass to Donald Driver and a 6-yard pass to Greg Jennings. The drive was capped off with a short right pass from Aaron Rodgers to linebacker turned tight end Spencer Havner. Havner pulled in the pass and ran down the right sideline 45 yards for a touchdown to claim a 7-3 Packers lead. The Browns then took over on offense trying to reclaim the lead from the Packers. After two incompletions and a 5-yard pass completion the Browns failed to reach the first down marker and looked to end the offensive series on a three and out. On the punt however, the Packers were penalized 5 yards for having 12 men on the field of play which gave the Browns a first down. The Browns still failed to capitalize on the Packers mistake by only gaining 4 yards on the next three plays and settled for another punt. The Packers offense took over again at their own 14. On first down, running back Ryan Grant rushed for 6 yards and 4 on second down, but tight end Donald Lee was flagged for holding on the second rushing attempt, moving the Packers back 10 yards. Lee made up for his mistake on the new play though, hauling in a 19-yard reception for a first down. On the next play, Rodgers dropped back to pass and hit Donald Driver in stride between two defenders. Driver accelerated down field past an oncoming safety and into the end zone for a 71-yard touchdown to increase the Packers lead to 14-3. The Browns offense took to the field to try to out-fox the Packers defense. On the sixth play of the drive though, quarterback Derek Anderson was intercepted by Packers cornerback Charles Woodson in which he returned down to the Browns 15-yard line for a 25-yard return. Ryan Grant then rushed the ball for nine yards on second down to the Browns 3-yard line to set up first and goal at the three. After an incomplete pass to Greg Jennings, Ryan Grant rushed for 2 more yards on second down falling a yard short of the touchdown. Rodgers then passed to Donald Driver on third and one but the pass was incomplete. Fortunately, the Browns defender covering Driver was flagged for pass inference and the Packer were rewarded with a first and goal at the 1-yard line. After a Grant run for no gain and a John Kuhn rush for no gain, Ryan Grant then managed to break the goal line on third down to score a touchdown for the Packers extending the lead even more to 21-3. The Browns took over with less than a minute remaining in the half but managed to have to settle for one final hail Mary attempt into the end zone which was batted down incomplete to end the half with the Packers leading 21-3. After the half, the Packers started out with possession and managed to move the ball down to the Browns 37-yard line with multiple short yardage gains both passing and rushing. After an offensive pass interference penalty on Donald Lee, the Packers failed to convert on third and 20 and had to settle for a 55-yard field goal attempt on which kicker Mason Crosby missed wide left. The Browns then took over after the missed attempt and running back Jamal Lewis rushed for 4 yards on first and 4 on second down to set the Browns up with a 3rd and 2 on the Packers 47. On third down, Anderson dropped back to pass and threw a ball short right to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Charles Woodson immediately hit Cribbs knocking the ball out of his possession. The ball was recovered by the Packers at the Packers 48 by Packers linebacker Brandon Chillar. The Packers offense then got into another string of multiple rushing attempts in which was started out with a 15-yard carry by Grant.  Rodgers also completed a 16-yard pass to Donald Lee on the drive which stalled when a short pass to Ryan Grant on third down  and four only gained three yards down to the Browns 1-yard line. Crosby came onto the field and converted a chip shot field goal to extend the Packers lead to 24-3. The Browns managed to move the ball much more effectively than previous attempts on their corresponding drive moving the ball all the way down into the red zone. In the drive that in which extended into the fourth quarter, The Browns offense was held on four straight attempts inside the Packers four-yard line. The drive ended when the Browns choose to go for it on fourth down at the one, but the Anderson pass flew over wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi and out of the back of the end zone. The Packers then took over at their own 1-yard line and managed to move the ball 99 yards for another touchdown. The drive was highlighted by an 18-yard pass to Jennings, a 14-yard pass to Spencer Havner and a 19-yard scamper by Aaron Rodgers down to the Browns 39-yard line. Ryan Grant broke loose on the next play of the drive for 37 yards down the right sideline to the Browns 5-yard line. Rodgers then connected with James Jones in the lower left corner of the end zone for the final touchdown of the game, which extended the lead to 31-3. Both teams then continued to exchange rather meaningless possessions with the Packers offense now being run by backup quarterback Matt Flynn. The Packers final drive of the game started with 5:52 remaining on the clock and multiple rush attempts along with a Flynn pass to Jennings for 12 yards ran the clock down to 35 seconds. The Browns took over and rushed the ball once in which the game clock then expired to give the Packers their second successive victory, this time 31-3 over the Cleveland Browns. During the contest second-year tight end Jermichael Finley and fourth-string wide receiver Brett Swain both were removed for the game because of knee injuries. With the win, the Packers increased their record to 4-2 to hold onto second place in the division behind the Minnesota Vikings at 6-1, who lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers and ahead of the 3-3 Chicago Bears who also were defeated by the Cincinnati Bengals later in the day.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points in total were scored in the game?",
