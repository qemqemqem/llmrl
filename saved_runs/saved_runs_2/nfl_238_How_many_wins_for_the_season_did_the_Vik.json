In the first quarter, RB Artose Pinner (a former Lion) helped Minnesota gain an early lead with a 3-yard and a 4-yard TD run. In the second quarter, QB Brad Johnson got a 3-yard TD run, yet it was followed up with a failed 2-point conversion. Detroit would retaliate with DB Jamar Fletcher returning an interception 88 yards for a touchdown, while kicker Jason Hanson kicked a 53-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes got a 30-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell, yet Detroit's Hanson nailed a 45-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Pinner helped wrap the game up with a 1-yard TD run. Even though Lions QB Jon Kitna would complete a 23-yard TD pass to RB Kevin Jones, Minnesota held on to sweep Detroit. With the win, the Vikings improved to 6-7.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many wins for the season did the Vikings come into the game at?",
