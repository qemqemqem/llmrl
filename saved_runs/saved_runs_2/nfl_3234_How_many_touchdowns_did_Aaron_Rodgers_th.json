Seattle's defense was without safety Earl Thomas, who is now out for the year with a broken leg. They only managed one sack on the final play in the third quarter, ending a streak of 10 consecutive quarters without a sack. Aaron Rodgers, with a 3:0 TD-INT ratio, posted a 150.8 passer rating in this game, the highest allowed by the Seattle defense since Pete Carroll became head coach in 2010.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Aaron Rodgers throw?",
