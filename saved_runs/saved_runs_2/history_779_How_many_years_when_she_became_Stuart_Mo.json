    "commentary_on_process": "To solve the problem, I first determined that Anne became the last Stuart monarch in 1702. Then, I found out that Sophia of Hanover died in August 1714, two months before Anne's death. Therefore, the number of years between Anne becoming the last Stuart monarch and Sophia's death is 12. I could have solved the problem better by breaking it down into even smaller parts, such as calculating the exact number of days between the two events, but that level of detail was not necessary for this particular problem.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe 1688 Glorious Revolution replaced James II and VII with his Protestant daughter Mary II and her husband William III and II. Since neither Mary or her sister Anne had surviving children, the 1701 Act of Settlement ensured a Protestant successor by excluding Catholics from the English and Irish thrones, and that of Great Britain after the 1707 Act of Union. When Anne became the last Stuart monarch in 1702, her heir was the distantly related but Protestant Sophia of Hanover, not her Catholic half-brother James Francis Edward. Sophia died two months before Anne in August 1714; her son became George I and the pro-Hanoverian Whigs controlled government for the next 30 years.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years when she became Stuart Monarch 1702 till Anne died August 1714?",
