    "problem_text": "Context:\nLooking to bounce back from a heartbreaking loss the previous week, the Patriots played a wild back-and-forth game against the rival Jets in what would be their only overtime contest of the season. The Patriots marched deep into their own territory on the opening drive of the game, but were forced to punt. The Jets responded with an 11 play, 75-yard drive, aided by a defensive holding penalty on Ras-I Dowling giving the Jets a first down, and scoring on a Shonn Greene 1-yard touchdown run. Devin McCourty returned the ensuing kickoff 104 yards for a touchdown. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots raced 58 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, taking a 14-7 lead. Two possessions later, Mark Sanchez fumbled the snap and kicked the ball out of the end zone for a safety, increasing the Patriots lead to 16-7 early in the second quarter. After a Patriots punt, the Jets drove to the Patriots 36, but Sanchez was intercepted by Dennard at the Patriots 2 for no gain. The Patriots drove to the Jets 45, but punted, as well. Starting at their own 5, the Jets raced to the Patriots 36, and Nick Folk nailed a 54-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 16-10 at halftime. Joe McKnight returned the kickoff 37 yards to the Jets 32. With the decent starting field position, the Jets drove 66 yards to the Patriots 3, but the Patriots defense stiffened and forced the Jets to settle for Folk's 21-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 16-13. The Patriots countered on their next drive, putting together a 15 play, 67-yard drive in just under six minutes, converting three third-downs, and scoring on a two-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 23-13. Two possessions later, the Jets engineered a 14 play, 91-yard drive, converting three third-downs, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Sanchez to Dustin Keller, trimming the deficit to 23-20. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets marched to the Patriots 25 and Folk tied the game with his 43-yard field goal. The situation turned to disaster for the Patriots when Lex Hilliard forced McCourty to fumble and Asher Allen recovered at the Patriots 18. Hightower sacked Sanchez for a 10-yard loss on third down and Folk kicked a 43-yard field goal, giving the Jets a 26-23 lead. Starting at their own 21, the Patriots marched 54 yards to the Jets 25 and Gostkowski tied the game on his 43-yard field goal as time expired. The Patriots received their opening kickoff of overtime, marching 54 yards to the Jets 30 and Gostkowski gave the Patriots the 29-26 lead on a 48-yard field goal. The Jets reached their own 40, but on 2nd-and-10, Sanchez was sacked by Ninkovich and Jermaine Cunningham with Ninkovich recovering and sealing the win. With the win, the Patriots improved to 4-3.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards long  was The Patriots'drive?",
