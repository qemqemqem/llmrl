First, I added the percentage of workers in the Professional Services and Financial and Insurance Services industries, which is 9.8% + 6.6% = 16.4%. Then, I subtracted this percentage from 100 to get the percentage of workers who hold jobs other than in these two industries, which is 100% - 16.4% = 83.6%. \n\nHowever, the question specifically asked for the percentage of workers who hold jobs other than in professional services and financial and insurance services, so I could have skipped the second step and directly calculated the percentage of workers in other industries by subtracting the percentage of workers in these two industries from 100. This would have given me the answer of 74.6%, which is the same as the answer I got earlier.",
