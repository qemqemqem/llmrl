From the given information, I calculated that the Rams scored 10 points in the third quarter, which brought their total score to 33 points. Since the Broncos scored only 7 points in the third quarter, their total score was 23 points. Therefore, the Rams were ahead by 10 points at the end of the third quarter, and they were also ahead to start the fourth quarter.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have taken notes while reading the context to keep track of the scores of both teams in each quarter.

In the first quarter the Rams trailed early as Knowshon Moreno got a 4-yard TD run, followed by kicker Matt Prater nailing a 49-yard field goal. They cut the lead down with QB Sam Bradford getting a 36-yard TD pass to TE Michael Hoomanawanui. The deficit increased as Prater made a 40-yard field goal. They pulled ahead with Bradford completing a 2 and a 26-yard TD pass to TE Billy Bajema, followed by kicker Josh Brown nailing a 28 and a 37-yard field goal. This was followed in the third quarter by RB Kenneth Darby getting a 1-yard TD run. The lead was narrowed with QB Kyle Orton making a 41-yard TD pass to Lloyd, but it was expanded after Brown got a 26-yard field goal. The Broncos tried to come back as Orton completed a 16 and a 5-yard TD pass to wide receivers Eddie Royal and Brandon Lloyd, but the Rams' defense held them on for the win.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team was ahead to start the fourth quarter?",
