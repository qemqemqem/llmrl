    "problem_text": "Context:\nLater that week, the Lions stayed at home, donned their throwback uniforms again, and played their 69th annual Thanksgiving Day game against the then 10-1 Tennessee Titans. It was the Lions' only nationally televised game of the regular season and the only one amongst the final six home games that wasn't blacked out, although the Lions needed a 24-hour extension to sell out Ford Field. In the first quarter, Detroit trailed early as Titans RB Chris Johnson ran for a 6-yard TD.  The Lions responded with Jason Hanson kicking a 53-yard field goal.  Tennessee answered with Johnson running 58-yards for a score, along with DE Dave Ball returning an interception 15 yards for a TD.  In the second quarter, Detroit's misery continued as RB LenDale White scored on runs of 6 yards and 2 yards.  Detroit ended the half with QB Daunte Culpepper completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Michael Gaines. In the third quarter, the Titans pulled away as kicker Rob Bironas kicked field goals of 49 and 41 yards.  In the fourth quarter, Tennessee scored two more times when Bironas nailed 45 and 43-yard field goals. The 47 points were most points that Detroit had ever given up on Thanksgiving Day as they fell to 0-12. It also became the second successive NFL season to see a team start out 0-12 after the Miami Dolphins in 2007.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many wins did the Titans have before the game?",
