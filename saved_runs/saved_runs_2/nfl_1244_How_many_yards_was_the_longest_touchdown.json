    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Seahawks began their 2008 campaign on the road against the Buffalo Bills. In the first quarter, Seattle trailed early as Bills RB Marshawn Lynch got a 21-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Seahawks continued to struggle as WR/PR Roscoe Parrish returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown.  Seattle responded with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson. Buffalo closed out the half with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 35-yard and a 38-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, the Seahawks replied with kicker Olindo Mare nailing a 45-yard field goal.  However, the Bills pulled a trick play on Seattle. Appearing to go for a 32-yard field goal, Buffalo's holder (punter Brian Moorman) instead threw a 19-yard TD pass to DE Ryan Denney. The Bills pulled away with QB Trent Edwards completing a 30-yard TD pass to TE Robert Royal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown pass of the game?",
