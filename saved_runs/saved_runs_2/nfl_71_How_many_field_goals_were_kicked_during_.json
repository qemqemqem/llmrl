    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to end their three-game losing skid, the Panthers played their final home game of the year against the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers.  With QB Jake Delhomme's thumb still sore, Chris Weinke once again got the start.  After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina's recent struggles continued with QB Ben Roethlisberger's 1-yard TD run, kicker Jeff Reed's 19-yard field goal, and Roethlisberger's 13-yard TD pass to RB Najeh Davenport.  Afterwards, the Panthers got their only score of the game with kicker John Kasay getting a 37-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, more Panther trouble continued with Reed's 45-yard field goal and RB Willie Parker's 41-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, WR Santonio Holmes returned a punt 65-yards for a touchdown, while Josh Reed booted a 26-yard field goal.  With their fourth-straight loss, the Panthers fell to 6-8.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were kicked during the game?",
