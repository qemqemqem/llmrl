    "problem_text": "Context:\nBack at home, the Dallas Cowboys traveled to Nashville to face off against the Titans. The Titans started their rookie quarterback Vince Young after veteran Kerry Collins produced dismal results after the first 3 games of the season. The Titans were able to score with a field goal on their opening drive making it the first time this season that they were able to score in the first quarter. The Titans were held to two field goals in the first half while the Cowboys had a lead at halftime with two 13-yard TD passes from Drew Bledsoe to WR Terry Glenn to put them up 14-6. The Cowboys continued to drive up the score during the 3rd quarter with a 5-yard touchdown run by RB Julius Jones. During this play Titans' DT Albert Haynesworth stepped on the face of Cowboys center Andre Gurode. Haynesworth was flagged for Unsportsmanlike Conduct and ejected from the game. He protested his ejection by taking off his helmet and throwing it on the ground. He was then flagged again with another Unsportsmanlike Conduct penalty. Gurode left the field with an ice pack to his face and required stitched above his left eye. He did not return to the field. Head Coach Jeff Fisher as well as Haynesworth later apologized for his actions. Vince Young connected for his second touchdown of the year to TE Ben Troupe.  During the 4th quarter, the Cowboys scored on a field goal by Mike Vanderjagt. LB Brady James intercepted Vince Young's pass intended for Ben Troupe and returned it for a touchdown. The Cowboys sealed the win with a 7-yard TD run by Tyson Thompson with a final score of 45 to 14. The Cowboys moved to 2 and 1 while the Titans continued to losing streak dropping to 0-4.\n\nQuestion:\nWho caught the most touchdown passes in the first half?",
