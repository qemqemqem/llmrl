    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Raiders were eliminated from playoff contention with a loss by Miami the previous day, but traveled to Philadelphia for a Christmas night game against the NFL-best 12-2 Eagles. After the Eagles punted on their first drive, Oakland drove to the Eagles' 42, but failed convert on fourth down. Eagles quarterback Nick Foles, playing for the injured Carson Wentz, then led the team down the field and opened the scoring on a 17-yard touchdown pass to Jay Ajayi to put the home team up 7-0. After the teams traded punts, Carr threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper to tie the game up early in the second quarter. Philadelphia found themselves in scoring position late in the half, but rookie kicker Jake Elliott missed a 33-yard try right before the half leaving the game tied at seven. Starting the second half, the Raiders moved into Philly's red zone, but were held out of the end zone and forced to settle for a field goal by Giorgio Tavecchio to take a 10-7 lead. On the Raiders' next possession, Carr was intercepted by CB Patrick Robinson ending the Raiders promising drive. Two plays later, Ajayi fumbled and the Raiders took over. However, on the first offensive play for the Raiders, Marshawn Lynch to lost his first fumble of the season and resulting in three turnovers in four plays. The Eagles used that possession to kick another field goal to tie things up at 10-each. Defensive efforts and poor offense by both teams caused them to trade punts again going into the fourth quarter. The Raiders, taking over close to midfield, marched into Eagles territory, but Tavecchio missed a 48-yard field goal to leave the game tied. On the Eagles' next drive, Foles threw an interception and the Raiders drove deep into Philadelphia territory poised to take the lead. However, Jalen Richard turned the ball over on a fumble, the Raiders third turnover of the game. Following punts by both teams, the Raiders took over near midfield with the opportunity to set up a potential game-winning drive. However, with less than a minute to go, Carr threw another pick, the Raiders fourth turnover in the game. Philadelphia used the momentum to close into field goal range, and Elliott connected on a 48-yard try to give the home team the lead with 22 seconds left. Oakland took over on their own 40 with all three timeouts, but moved nowhere. On fourth down, with three seconds left, the Raiders began to lateral the ball as the clock expired attempting to score, but ended up fumbling the ball and the Eagles Derek Barnett returned it for a touchdown. The Eagles took a knee on the extra point try. The Raider defense played well, allowing 216 yards to the Eagles, but the Raider offense lost three fumbles in the game and Carr threw two interceptions. With the loss, the Raiders fell to 6-9 on the season, their third losing season in four years with Derek Carr as QB, and to third place in the division.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player missed one field goal and scored one field goal?",
