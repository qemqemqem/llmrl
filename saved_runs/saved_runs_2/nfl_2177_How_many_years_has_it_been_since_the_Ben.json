    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Bengals started their regular season against the Cleveland Browns, in front of 67,321 spectators at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. On the Bengals' opening drive, the team drove 53-yards and got a field goal. The Bengals' next two drives were a touchdown and another field goal, respectively. Cleveland scored two touchdowns in the second quarter to be up 14-13 going into halftime. On the Bengals' final offensive play before halftime, Dalton was sacked and injured; he did not play the rest of the game. The Bengals were the first to get the ball in the third quarter, but it did not score the entire quarter. On the other hand, the Browns kicked a field goal in the third to go up by four points. In the final quarter, the Bengals scored two touchdowns, including the longest play of the game: a 44-yard reception to Green. With the win, the Bengals began the season 1-0 and secured their first regular season opening day win since 2007. Also, Dalton became the fifth quarterback to win his road debut as a rookie.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years has it been since the Bengals won on opening day?",
