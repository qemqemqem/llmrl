    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Vikings the Bears played on home ground for an interconference duel with the Jets. In the first quarter the Bears took the lead as kicker Robbie Gould got a 37-yard field goal, followed by Matt Forte getting a 22-yard TD run. They trailed with RB Shonn Greene getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by CB Dwight Lowery returning an interception 20 yards for a touchdown, followed by RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 3-yard TD run letting the Jets lead 21-10. The Bears tried to cut the lead as QB Jay Cutler scrambled 2 yards for a touchdown, but the lead was soon extended as kicker Nick Folk made a 26-yard field goal. They got the lead back with Cutler completing a 40 and a 25-yard TD pass to wide receivers Devin Hester and Johnny Knox respectively, but soon the game was tied with QB Mark Sanchez throwing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes. The Bears escaped the tie with Cutler finding Knox again on a 26-yard TD pass. After a 34-yard field goal from Folk, and the Bears punting, the Jets attempted to score with less than a minute left in the game, but a Chris Harris interception would seal the game for the Bears. With the win, Chicago improved to 11-4, and clinched a first-round bye when the Eagles lost to the Vikings.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest field goal?",
