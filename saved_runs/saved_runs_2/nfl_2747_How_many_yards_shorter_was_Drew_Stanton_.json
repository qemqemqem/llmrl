    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn week 11, the 7-2, NFC North-leading Lions flew to Phoenix to face the NFC West's first place team, the 8-1 Arizona Cardinals. In the first quarter, the Cardinals picked up two touchdowns to open the game. Michael Floyd caught a pair of touchdown passes from Drew Stanton, from 42 yards and 12 yards out, giving them an early lead they never relinquished. Detroit's Matt Prater hit a pair of field goals, first a 50-yard kick in the first quarter then a 28-yarder late in the second quarter, to cut the lead to 14-6 at halftime. Neither team scored in the second half. The Lions, plagued by several penalties on both sides of the ball, saw their four-game winning streak snapped.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards shorter was Drew Stanton's second touchdown pass compared to his first?",
