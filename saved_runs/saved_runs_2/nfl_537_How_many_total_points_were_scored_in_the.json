    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns remained at home for their Week 2 game with their interstate rivals, the Cincinnati Bengals. Coming into the game, the Bengals held a one-game advantage over the Browns in the all-time series, 34-33 . However, the Browns defeated the Bengals in a high-scoring contest, 51-45, which saw 12 offensive touchdowns - and tied the overall series between the two teams at 34 wins each. The game opened with a 13-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer to running back Rudi Johnson - the first receiving touchdown of his career. After a Cleveland punt, safety Sean Jones intercepted a Palmer pass intended for Chad Johnson, which gave the Browns possession. However, they were unable to score a touchdown, and scored with a 39-yard Phil Dawson field goal instead. After a Bengals punt, Dawson kicked another 39-yard field goal before the end of the quarter. The Bengals began the second quarter with Rudi Johnson fumbling the football, which was recovered by cornerback Leigh Bodden. Derek Anderson, starting after the team's trade of Charlie Frye during the week, completed a pass to Joe Jurevicius in the back of the endzone for a 17-yard touchdown, putting the Browns ahead 13-7. The Bengals countered with another touchdown pass, this time a 23-yard pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh. Browns head coach Romeo Crennel challenged the ruling on the field that the receiver was in bounds on the catch, but the officials upheld the call. On the ensuing kickoff, Josh Cribbs returned the ball 88&#160;yards to the Bengals' 11-yard line. The drive was capped off with a 9-yard pass from Anderson to Jurevicius, giving him his second touchdown reception of the game and putting the Browns ahead 20-14. The Bengals answered the Browns' touchdown pass with another score of their own, this time a 22-yard pass to Chad Johnson. Johnson was wide open in the endzone, uncovered because Bodden had slipped. After his catch, Johnson attempted to find the Browns' Dawg Pound so he could jump into it and keep his pregame promise to do so if he scored. He was unable to do so, though, since he had scored in the end zone opposite the Dawg Pound. Following the Bengals' score, the Browns answered with a 97-yard kickoff return to Cincinnati's four-yard line by Cribbs; however, due to several penalties on the play, it was called back. Though the team was penalized, Anderson eventually threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Kellen Winslow II to give the Browns a 27-21 lead at halftime. The Bengals began the third quarter with a Dexter Jackson interception of Anderson, and the team gained ground on the Browns with a 20-yard Shayne Graham field goal. On the Browns' next drive, Anderson hooked up with Braylon Edwards for a 34-yard touchdown pass, allowing the Browns to increase their lead to ten points again, 34-24. However, just as in the first half, the Bengals answered the Browns' score with a score of their own, a 14-yard touchdown pass to Chad Johnson. Carrying out his promise, Johnson leaped into the Dawg Pound, where a fan poured beer onto him. With the Bengals only trailing by three points, running back Jamal Lewis exploded out of the backfield and ran 66&#160;yards for a touchdown to increase the Browns' lead back to ten points. Five minutes later, on the next drive, Carson Palmer hit T. J. Houshmandzadeh, this time a 5-yard touchdown pass, to bring the Browns' lead back to three. The Browns' next drive was cut short on a fourth-and-short rushing attempt by fullback Lawrence Vickers; however, the Bengals were forced to punt on their next drive, and managed to down the ball inside the Browns' ten-yard line. The Browns answered the Bengals' third-quarter touchdown with a 37-yard pass from Anderson to Edwards, again increasing the lead to ten points, 48-38. After another punt by the Bengals, Phil Dawson kicked his third field goal of the game, from 18&#160;yards, to give the Browns a 13-point lead. With time running down, Palmer led his team to yet another score, this time on a 7-yard pass to Glenn Holt, to cut the Browns' lead to six points. However, this would be the final scoring drive of the game; the Browns punted on their next possession, which was followed by a Leigh Bodden interception of a Palmer pass in Browns territory as Palmer was attempting to lead his team on a quick scoring drive. The play was reviewed by officials but upheld, allowing Derek Anderson to take a knee to run the clock out and win his first game as a starting quarterback. Browns' quarterback Derek Anderson tied a franchise record with five touchdown passes in the game. Running back Jamal Lewis also became the first Browns running back in more than 20 years, rushing for 215&#160;yards on 22 carries and scoring a touchdown. Wide receiver Braylon Edwards and tight end Kellen Winslow also added more than 100&#160;yards receiving each: Edwards had eight receptions for 146&#160;yards with two touchdowns, and Winslow had six catches for 100&#160;yards and a touchdown. The teams' combined score at the end of the game was 96 points; the teams together scored 106 points in a game in 2004. The rivals now own two of the top scoring games in the history of the league. Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer also set a franchise record with his six touchdown passes, while wide receiver Chad Johnson became the franchise's all-time leader in receiving yards. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. For his performance against the Bengals, quarterback Derek Anderson was named the AFC Player of the Week. Anderson was 20-for-33 passing with five touchdowns and one interception for a passer rating of 121.0.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total points were scored in the game?",
