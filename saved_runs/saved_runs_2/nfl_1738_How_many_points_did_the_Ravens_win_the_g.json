    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to beat the defending Super Bowl champs, the Ravens returned home. New Orleans struck first with an 18-yard pass from Drew Brees to Jimmy Graham, but Baltimore quickly answered with Flacco throwing a 34-yard pass to Ed Dickson. The Ravens then followed with two touchdowns, both by Ray Rice, one rushing (10&#160;yards) and one passing (17&#160;yards), to bring the score up 21-7. At the close of the half, the Saints scored on a 1-yard pass to Graham to bring the halftime score to 21-14. The Saints kicked a field goal to enter the third quarter to make it 21-17, but the Ravens quickly answered that with a field goal to make it 24-17. The Saints tied it in the fourth quarter on a 15-yard touchdown pass to Lance Moore in the corner of the end zone, a play that was challenged by Baltimore but not overturned. The Ravens managed to get ahead with a Billy Cundiff field goal with 10:03 remaining 27-24.The Saints had the ball in the final minutes backed up near their own end zone when Drew Brees threw an interception to Cory Redding to give Baltimore a chance to run off the clock. Though there was not enough time to run off the entire clock, Baltimore managed to leave just 9&#160;seconds as they kicked a field goal to make it 30-24. The Saints had one last chance on their kickoff return in which they pitched it around in hopes of a touchdown, but they were stopped. They were also called for a moot penalty for a forward pass that would have rendered any drive at this point null. Overall, the game was highlighted by Ray Rice's 153&#160;yards rushing and two touchdowns, Billy Cundiff's two field goals, and the Redding interception that virtually ended the game. With the win, the Ravens went to 10-4, nearly clinching a playoff berth.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Ravens win the game by?",
