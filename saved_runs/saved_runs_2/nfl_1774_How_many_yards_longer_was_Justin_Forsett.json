    "problem_text": "Context:\n Hoping to increase their winning streak the Bears returned to Chicago for an NFC duel with the Seattle Seahawks. The Bears took the early lead as RB Matt Forte got a six-yard TD run. But the Seahawks answered back with QB Matt Hasselbeck getting a 22-yard TD pass to WR Deon Butler, followed in the second quarter by RB Justin Forsett getting a 9-yard TD run. Then the Bears responded with kicker Robbie Gould making a 34 and a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Bears fell further behind when QB Jay Cutler was sacked in the endzone by free safety Jordan Babineaux for a safety. This was followed in the fourth quarter by RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run. The Bears tried to come back into the game but only came away with a touchdown after WR Devin Hester returned a punt 89 yards to the endzone for a touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Justin Forsett's first touchdown compared to Matt Forte's?",
