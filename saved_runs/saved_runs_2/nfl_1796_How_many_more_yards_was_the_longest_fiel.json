To find the difference, I subtracted 23 from 41, which gave me 18. Therefore, the difference between the longest and shortest field goal was 18 yards.\n\nSince this was a straightforward problem, there is not much room for improvement in terms of solving it.

    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a nine-game losing streak, the Bengals flew to Heinz Field for a Week 14 AFC North rematch with the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the first quarter, Cincinnati delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback Carson Palmer found offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth on a 1-yard touchdown pass.  In the second quarter, the Steelers answered with safety Troy Polamalu returning an interception 45 yards for a touchdown; followed by kicker Shaun Suisham nailing a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh added onto their lead with Suisham getting a 35-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers pulled away with linebacker LaMarr Woodley returning an interception 14 yards for a touchdown, followed by Suisham making a 41-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more yards was the longest field goal compared to the shortest?",
