In the first quarter, Chicago trailed early as Falcons kicker Jason Elam got a 29-yard and a 48-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Atlanta increased its lead with Elam getting a 32-yard field goal.  The Bears would get on the board as kicker Robbie Gould got a 36-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Falcons kept increasing their lead as Elam kicked a 41-yard field goal.  Chicago began to threaten as rookie RB Matt Fort&#233; got a 3-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Atlanta answered with QB Matt Ryan completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White.  The Bears would take the lead as Gould got a 32-yard field goal, while QB Kyle Orton completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Rashied Davis.  However, the Falcons got the last laugh as Elam nailed the game-winning 48-yard field goal.
