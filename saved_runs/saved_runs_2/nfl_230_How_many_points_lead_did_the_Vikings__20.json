I then recalled that a field goal is worth 3 points, and since the Vikings' score increased from 16 to 19, the field goal gave them a lead of 3 points. However, the question asked for the number of points lead given by the field goal, so I subtracted the Lions' score of 17 from the Vikings' score of 19 to get the answer of 2.\n\nTo solve the problem more efficiently, I could have simply subtracted the Lions' score of 17 from the Vikings' score of 19, which would have given me the answer of 2 without having to recall the value of a field goal.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter dropping two straight games, the Vikings came home for an NFC North fight with the Detroit Lions. The Vikings struck first with a 26-yard field goal which would be the only points scored in the first quarter. The Vikings wouldn't score again until the 4th quarter. Detroit got close but Napoleon Harris got his first interception of his five-year career at the end of the 1st. In the second quarter, Detroit quarterback Jon Kitna ran 8 yards to score a touchdown putting the Lions ahead 7-3. Detroit's next drive would result in a field goal to put them ahead 10-3. In the 3rd quarter, Detroit would recover a Viking funble and then go on to score another touchdown to bring their lead to 17-3. In the first minute of the 4th quarter, Viking's Travis Taylor scored a touchdown after a three-yard pass to bring the score to 17-10. The Lions' next drive would end in a forced fumble when Pat Williams burst through the line untouched, and Jon Kitna lost the ball which was picked up by the Vikings' Ben Leber, who ran it in for a touchdown; however, the extra point was blocked leaving the score at 17-16. Later, the Viking's scored a 20-yard field goal to take the lead 19-17. Detroit would then throw an interception on fourth and ten to E.J. Henderson who would run 45 yards to score a touchdown bringing the score to 26-17 and the Vikings Darren Sharper got an interception in the last minute to seal the victory, bringing their record up to 3-2.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points lead did the Vikings' 20-yard field goal give them?",
