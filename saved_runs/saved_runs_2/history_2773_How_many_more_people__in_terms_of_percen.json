I misunderstood the question and calculated the percentage difference between the largest and smallest ethnic groups instead of the third largest and the combined percentage of the two smallest ethnic groups. To solve the problem correctly, I should have followed the steps I outlined earlier, which are:\n\n1. Calculate the total percentage of the two smallest ethnic groups combined.\n2. Calculate the percentage of the third largest ethnic group.\n3. Subtract the total percentage of the two smallest ethnic groups combined from the percentage of the third largest ethnic group to find the percentage difference.\n\nUsing this method, the correct answer is 1.2%.\n\nIn the future, I will make sure to read the question more carefully and double-check my calculations to avoid making similar mistakes.",
