The estimated population of ethnic Nigerians in South Africa, Gambia, Ireland, and Portugal is unknown, so it is impossible to compare their populations to that of Canada.

There are also large groups in  Nigerians in Ireland ,  Portugal and many other countries. .Inspiration for emigration is based heavily on socio-economical issues such as warfare, insecurity, economical instability and civil unrest. Between 1400-1900, of 1.4 million of 2 million emigrants were slaves sent to the Americas. This is due to the fact that the land now known as Nigeria was a central point for 4 slave trades during the 19th century. Though bondage represented a great deal, an estimated 30,000 Nigerian inhabitants would relocate to Kano City and Gambia to take advantage of financial opportunities afforded by fertile land and available natural resources. Whats more, the presence of gold mines and rail lines along the Gold Coast, present-day Ghana, attracted an estimated 6,500 Nigerian citizens to attain financial gain and opportunity. The population of Nigerians in Ghana rose to roughly 149,000 before the 1969 alien expulsion order would displace nearly the entire population to surrounding countries.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat 4 countries have more ethnic Nigerians than Canada?",
