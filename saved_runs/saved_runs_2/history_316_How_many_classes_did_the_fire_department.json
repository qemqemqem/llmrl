These firefighters operate out of 20 companies located throughout the city: 16 engine companies, two tower companies, and one ladder company. Training, Fire Marshall, Operations, and Administration are the divisions of the department. The department operates on a 24/48 schedule and had a Class 1 ISO rating until late 2008, when ISO officially lowered it to Class 3.  Russell  Thomas served as Fire Chief until June 2008, and was succeeded by Chief Thomas Carr in November 2008.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many classes did the fire department's ISO rating drop in 2008?",
