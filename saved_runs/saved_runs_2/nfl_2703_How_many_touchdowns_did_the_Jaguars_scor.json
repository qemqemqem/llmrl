    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns entered this game with a 3-2 record, coming off a blowout victory over the Steelers and were looking to win their third consecutive game.  Meanwhile, the Jaguars entered with a 0-6 record, and a 9-game losing streak, coming off a tough loss to the Tennessee Titans.  Despite being heavy favorites to win this matchup, the Browns were routed 24-6.  The Browns led 6-0 late in the first half and had the opportunity to kick a field goal and go up 9-0.  Instead, Browns HC Mike Pettine opted to go for it on 4th & 1. The conversion attempt failed, and within seconds, the Jaguars scored a touchdown to close out the half, leading 7-6.  Following a lost fumble by Brian Hoyer, the Jaguars added a field goal to make it 10-6.  In the fourth, the Browns finally imploded. KR Jordan Poyer attempted to catch the punt at the Browns' 2 yard line; the ball went off his facemask, and the Jaguars recovered, scoring a touchdown on their next drive to make it 17-6.  On the Browns' next drive, Hoyer threw an interception and the Jags converted another touchdown a few seconds later, making the final score 24-6.  After committing only 2 turnovers in their first 5 games, the Browns committed 3 turnovers against the Jaguars.  17 of the Jaguars' 24 points came off turnovers.  The defense picked off Blake Bortles three times, but they were able to score only 3 points off of those turnovers.  Hoyer struggled mightily throughout the game, going 16/41 for 215 yards, 0 touchdowns, an interception, and a lost fumble.  It was the Browns' lowest scoring output of the season and the fewest points that they had scored with Hoyer as their starting quarterback.  It was the first time that the Browns had failed to score a touchdown in a game since Week 2 against the Ravens (in the 2013 season). It was also the first time that the Browns failed to score any points in the second half (it last occurred in Week 2 of the 2013 season when the Browns were outscored by the Ravens 14-0 in the second half). The Jaguars won their first game of the season to improve to 1-6; The Browns' record dropped to 3-3 as they fell to 4th place in the AFC North.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did the Jaguars score in the first half?",
