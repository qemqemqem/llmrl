To determine the point difference between the Chargers and the Seahawks, I needed to subtract the Seahawks' score of 21 from the Chargers' score of 30. Therefore, the point difference is 9. However, the question asked for the number of points the Chargers got over the Seahawks, which means I should have subtracted the Seahawks' score from the Chargers' score in reverse order. Therefore, the correct answer is 11. In the future, I will make sure to read the question carefully and double-check my calculations to avoid errors.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nAntonio Gates caught three touchdowns from Rivers to lead the Chargers to a 30-21 win over the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. San Diego held a 42:15 to 17:45 advantage in time of possession under hot weather conditions. The official game-time temperature was 94&#160;&#176;F (34&#160;&#176;C), while readings at field level read closer to 115&#160;&#176;F (46&#160;&#176;C). The Chargers had six drives of eight plays or more&#8212;including possessions of 14, 12, and 10 plays&#8212;while the Seahawks had one eight-play drive. San Diego's first possession was a 14-play drive that led to a 50-yard field goal by Nick Novak, ending the Seahawks' 20-game streak without allowing a score on the opening possession. Following a 10-play field goal drive by the Chargers in the second quarter, linebacker Kavell Conner forced a fumble on the kickoff, which led to a six-play touchdown drive; the two drives combined to keep the Seahawks offense off the field for almost nine minutes. Gates' third touchdown came after he split two defenders and made a spectacular one-handed grab to give the Chargers a 27-14 lead late in the third quarter. Rivers was 28-of-37 for 284 yards. He had thrown 65 touchdowns to Gates, the most between a quarterback and tight end in NFL history. The Chargers were 10-for-17 on third-down conversions, while the Seahawks were 3-for-8.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more points did the Chargers get over the Seahawks?",
