In the first quarter, Seattle trailed early as QB Eli Manning completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Domenik Hixon.  The Seahawks responded with kicker Olindo Mare completing a 30-yard field goal, yet New York answered with RB Brandon Jacobs getting a 3-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead with kicker John Carney getting a 29-yard field goal, Jacobs getting a 1-yard TD run, and Carney making a 33-yard field goal.  Seattle closed out the half with Mare kicking a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New York pulled away as Manning completed a 23-yard TD pass to WR Sinorice Moss, along with Carney nailing a 35-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants sealed the win as QB David Carr completed a 5-yard TD pass to Moss.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did John Carney kick?",
