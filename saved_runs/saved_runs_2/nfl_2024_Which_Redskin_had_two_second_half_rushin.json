    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their home win over the Colts, the Eagles flew to FedExField for a Week 10 NFC East rematch with the Washington Redskins on Monday night.  Philadelphia wasted no time kicking off the first quarter as on the very first play of the game, quarterback Michael Vick found wide receiver DeSean Jackson on an 88-yard touchdown pass.  Afterwards, the Eagles added onto their lead with Vick's 7-yard touchdown run, followed by Vick finding running back LeSean McCoy on an 11-yard touchdown pass, along with running back Jerome Harrison's 50-yard touchdown run.  Philadelphia continued its dominating night in the second quarter as Vick hooked up with wide receiver Jeremy Maclin on a 48-yard touchdown pass.  The Redskins would answer with former Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to fullback Darrel Young, followed by a 3-yard touchdown pass to running back Keiland Williams.  Philadelphia responded with Vick's 6-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker David Akers booting a 48-yard field goal. Washington began the third quarter with Williams getting a 4-yard touchdown run.  Afterwards, the Eagles went back to work as Vick hooked up with wide receiver Jason Avant on a 3-yard touchdown pass, followed by cornerback Dimitri Patterson returning an interception 40 yards for a touchdown.  The Redskins tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Williams got a 32-yard touchdown run, but Philadelphia's defense (combined with their 31-point lead) held on to preserve the victory. The Philadelphia Eagles scored 59 points and 8 touchdowns, including 4 passing TDs, 3 rushing TDs and They racked up 592 yards of total offense, including 260 rushing yards and 332 passing yards. They were 4/4 in Red Zone Efficiency and 4/4 in Goal-to-Go Efficiency, were 8/13 in Third-Down Conversions and had 28 first downs. Michael Vick (20/28, 333 yards, 4 TDs, 8 carries, 80 yards, 2 TDs) became the first player in NFL history to have 300+ yards passing, 50+ yards rushing, 4+ passing touchdowns, and 2+ rushing touchdowns in the same game.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich Redskin had two second half rushing touchdowns?",
