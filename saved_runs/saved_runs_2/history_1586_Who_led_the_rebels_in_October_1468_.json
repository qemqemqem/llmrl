    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill, the people of Li\u00e8ge refused to accept Burgundian rule. In October 1468, 240 rebels, under Jean de Wilde, Vincent de Bueren and Gosuin de Streel, invaded the city. In the confusion, Guy of Humbercourt and the entire Burgundian garrison fled. Li\u00e8ge was free again and Jean de Wilde occupied the Prince-Bishops' palace. One night, a Li\u00e8ge militia attacked Tongeren and killed all Burgundians there. After this, Jean de Wilde opened negotiations with Guy of Humbercourt. But Charles the Bold had other plans: he led an army towards Li\u00e8ge to deal once and for all with the rebellious city. He was accompanied by Louis XI of France. Several cities on their path were plundered, including Tongeren. On 22 October, a 500-strong militia that tried to stop the Burgundians at the village of Lantin were driven into the church and burned alive. Vincent de Bueren organised the defence of the city of Li\u00e8ge and achieved some successes with hit-and-run sorties. Jean de Wilde was mortally wounded during the raid of 26 October and died two days later. Best known is the attack by the six hundred Franchimontois in the night of 29-30 October, who sneaked out of the city and attacked the sleeping Burgundians, with the aim of killing the Duke and the King. The plan failed and all 600, including Vincent de Bueren and Gosuin de Streel, were killed. The next day, Li\u00e8ge surrendered, and at the command of Charles the Bold, hundreds of Li\u00e8gois were tied together and thrown into the Meuse river. The city was set alight and is said to have burned for seven weeks.\n\nQuestion:\nWho led the rebels in October 1468?",
