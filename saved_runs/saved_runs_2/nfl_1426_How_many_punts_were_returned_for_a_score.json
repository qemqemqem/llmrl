With a scoreless first quarter the Cowboys scored a field goal and touchdown by Tony Romo to Roy Williams. However, the Giants countered by scoring two touchdowns in the second quarter. Nick Folk missed a 57-yard field goal just before halftime.In the third quarter, both teams scored touchdowns and Nick Folk missed a 42-yard field goal which would have put the Cowboys in front. In the fourth quarter the Giants scored two touchdowns, one being a 79-yard punt return by Domenik Hixon. Dallas would score a late touchdown from Romo to Miles Austin but the game ended with the Giants sweeping the series.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many punts were returned for a score?",
