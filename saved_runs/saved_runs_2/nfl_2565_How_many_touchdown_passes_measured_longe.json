    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Broncos kicked off their 2013 season at home against the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL kickoff game, in a highly publicized rematch of their 2012 Divisional playoff game. The Ravens grabbed the early lead in the first quarter, with quarterback Joe Flacco tossing a 2-yard touchdown pass to fullback Vonta Leach. Following a Flacco interception, the Broncos responded early in the second quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a 24-yard touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas. After Broncos' wide receiver Wes Welker muffed a punt return near the goal line, the Ravens grabbed the lead, with running back Ray Rice rushing for a 1-yard touchdown, but the Broncos responded, with Manning connecting with Julius Thomas on another touchdown pass &#8212; from 23 yards out. The Ravens grabbed a 17-14 lead just before halftime, with placekicker Justin Tucker nailing a 25-yard field goal. However, the Broncos would reel off 28 unanswered points, with Manning throwing four more touchdown passes &#8212; a 28-yarder to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, two to Welker from 5 and 2 yards out, followed in the fourth quarter by a 26-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. The second score came after Broncos' safety David Bruton blocked a Sam Koch punt. The Ravens later scored 10 unanswered points, with Flacco throwing a 13-yard touchdown to wide receiver Marlon Brown, followed by a 30-yard field goal from Tucker to pull to within 42-27 with 5:29 remaining in the fourth quarter. However, the Broncos subsequently put the game out of reach, after Manning threw his seventh touchdown pass of the game &#8212; a 78-yarder to Demaryius Thomas. The start of the game was delayed 33 minutes due to lightning in the Denver area.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes measured longer than 15-yards in length?",
