However, if the question had been more complex, I could have used other strategies such as drawing a diagram or creating a table to organize the information.",

Mark Sanchez threw four interceptions yet a short Titans punt gave the Jets the ball inside the Titans 25 in the final minute.   The Jets blew the snap and the Titans fell on the ball, ending the game. With the loss, the Jets not only fell to 6-8, but got mathematically eliminated from postseason contention for the second straight season. Tim Tebow entered the game for the first time since Week 10 and made what turned out to be his final plays with the Jets, missing on his only pass while rushing three times for fifteen yards.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did Chris Johnson run for a touchdown compared to Jake Locker?",
