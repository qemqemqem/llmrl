To solve the problem, I read through the given information and looked for details about the touchdowns scored by the Steelers. I did not find the answer to the question, so I made an assumption that the second longest touchdown pass was the 40-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Santonio Holmes. However, upon reviewing the information again, I realized that the question did not specify the length of the second longest touchdown pass. Therefore, I cannot provide a correct answer without more information. In the future, I will make sure to read the question more carefully and not make assumptions.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Cleveland Browns opened the regular season at home in Cleveland Browns Stadium against the Pittsburgh Steelers, who entered the game under the direction of the team's new head coach, Mike Tomlin. However, the Browns' ended the day with a 34-7 loss to the Steelers. A number of Browns errors gave Pittsburgh opportunities to take a first quarter lead. After being stopped on their first possession, the Browns were forced to punt. Paul Ernster fumbled the snap, which resulted in a poor kick, and the Browns were called for four penalties on the play. The Steelers took possession on the Browns' 22-yard line and scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Ben Ben Roethlisberger to Hines Ward. On the Browns' next possession, Charlie Frye threw an interception to Deshea Townsend, which eventually led to the Steelers' second score of the game, a 26-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. The Brown next possession ended when Jamal Lewis fumbled the ball at the Browns' 40-yard line. The Steelers quickly converted the turnover, with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes on the next play to bring the score to 17-0. After being sacked five times and throwing for only 34&#160;yards on 4-of-10 passing, Frye was removed from the game and was replaced by second-string quarterback Derek Anderson. In the second quarter, Willie Parker fumbled the ball and gave the Browns possession. However, the team was forced to punt, and just two drives later, the Browns fumbled the ball again - this time on a sack by Ryan Clark of Anderson. The Browns were able to hold the Steelers scoreless through the second quarter as Roethlisberger failed to connect on his last six pass attempts of the quarter. However, the Steelers also held the Browns scoreless, and the teams entered halftime with the Steelers ahead 17-0. The second half began well for the Steelers, with an eight-play, 71-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown pass to rookie Matt Spaeth. The Browns countered with a long drive of 76&#160;yards that ended with a one-yard touchdown pass from Anderson to second-year fullback Lawrence Vickers, cutting the deficit to 24-7. However, this would be the Browns' only score of the game. On the next drive, the Steelers answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Heath Miller, giving the Steelers a 31-7 advantage. The Browns punted on their next possession, and the Steelers capped an eight-minute drive with a 31-yard field goal by Reed, giving the Steelers a 34-7 lead, which they never surrendered. On the Browns' next offensive possession, Braylon Edwards dropped a pass from Anderson, which was ruled a fumble. Following a Steelers punt, Anderson threw an interception to Ike Taylor on a pass intended for Edwards, and Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch ran the clock out, securing the win. The loss put the Browns record at 0-1, and allowed the Steelers to take a one-game lead in the overall series, 56 wins to 55. Following the game, head coach Romeo Crennel stated that he didn't know who would start at quarterback in the next game versus the Cincinnati Bengals. He also stood by his decision not to insert rookie Brady Quinn into the game, even after chants were heard from the home crowd hoping otherwise. On Tuesday, September 11, the Browns traded Frye, who was expected to start against the Bengals in week two, to the Seattle Seahawks for a sixth-round draft choice. The Browns are the first team since 1970 to trade their starting quarterback before Week 2. The team's general manager, Phil Savage, stated that Anderson was to be named the team's new starting quarterback, with Quinn moving up the depth chart to be Anderson's backup. The Browns also re-signed Ken Dorsey, whom the team had cut just ten days earlier, to be the team's third-string quarterback and mentor to Quinn.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player caught the second longest touchdown pass?",
