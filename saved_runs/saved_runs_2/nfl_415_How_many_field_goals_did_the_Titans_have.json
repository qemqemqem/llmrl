    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter scratching off one Manning in one thriller, the Titans stayed at home for an AFC South rematch with their archrival Indianapolis Colts.  In the first quarter, the Colts struck first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 68-yard TD pass to WR Marvin Harrison for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Indianapolis increased its lead with RB Dominic Rhodes getting a 2-yard TD run.  Fortunately, the Titans started to creep back into the game, with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 25-yard field goal, while QB Vince Young completed a 20-yard TD pass to WR Drew Bennett.  After a scoreless third quarter, Tennessee took the lead with Young completing a 9-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Jones.  The Colts would tie the game up with kicker Adam Vinatieri completing a 20-yard field goal.  Fortunately, the Titans would get the win on Bironas' incredible 60-yard field goal, sealing the win after lasting out the clock. The win would boost the Titans to an improbable possible playoff berth and end Indianapolis' winning streak on the Titans which ended at 7 games spanning 4 years. With the amazing win over both Manning brothers, Tennessee improved to 5-7.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did the Titans have?",
