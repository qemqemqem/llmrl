    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Eagles snapped a three-game skid and dealt the 12-1 Dallas Cowboys an upset loss with a big effort from the defense. The defenses dominated the first quarter at Texas Stadium. Dallas got the first score in the second quarter on a field goal after Quintin Mikell fumbled away a Tony Romo pass he had just intercepted. But, Romo was picked off again on Dallas' next possession, this time by Lito Sheppard. Donovan McNabb and Brian Westbrook marched the Eagles to the one-yard line, where McNabb tossed a touchown pass to Reggie Brown for a 7-3 Philadelphia lead with seconds left in the half. On Dallas' second possession of the third quarter, Romo moved deep into Eagles' territory with two long passes to Patrick Crayton, but the Cowboys could only muster a field goal. A 13-play drive early in the fourth quarter led to short David Akers field goal and a 10-6 lead for the Eagles. Philadelphia had held second half leads over superior opponents for three straight weeks, but lost each game. This time, the defense shut down the Cowboys' efforts to score. Brian Dawkins recorded Philadelphia's third interception midway through the final quarter. With the Eagles possessing the ball at the Cowboy 25-yard line, just over two minutes left, and Dallas out of timeouts, Westbrook broke through the defense and had a clear path to the end zone. Westbrook went down at the 1-yard line and allowed the Eagles to run out the clock instead of scoring the touchdown and kicking the ball off. McNabb passed for 208 yards and rushed for 53 more, while Westbrook had 81 rushing yards and 63 receiving yards. The defense used three sacks and three interceptions to help contain the Dallas offense. The victory kept the Eagles' mathematical hopes alive of gaining the final wild card spot, but they were eliminated Monday night when the Minnesota Vikings defeated the Chicago Bears.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many total passing and rushing yards did McNabb have?",
