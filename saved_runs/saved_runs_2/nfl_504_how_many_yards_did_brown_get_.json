    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Jaguars, the Panthers went home for a Week 15 intraconference duel with the Seattle Seahawks. The game remained scorless for the first three quarters of play until kicker John Kasay finally delivered the game's first punch in the fourth quarter with a 53-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Seahawks would respond with kicker Josh Brown getting a 23-yard field goal. After that, Carolina clawed deep with Kasay nailing a 37-yard field goal and RB DeAngelo Williams getting a 35-yard touchdown run. Later, Seattle's only response would be QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Deion Branch. With the win, the Panthers kept their slim playoffs alive by improving to 6-8.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did brown get?",
