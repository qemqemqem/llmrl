    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to snap a four-game losing streak, the 49ers stayed at home for a Week 10 Thursday night duel with the Chicago Bears, as head coach Mike Singletary prepared to face his former team. After a scoreless first quarter, San Francisco would strike in the second quarter with a 14-yard touchdown run from running back Frank Gore. The Bears would close out the half with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 50-yard field goal. Chicago would creep closer in the third quarter as Gould nailed a 38-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Niners would add onto their lead as kicker Joe Nedney booted a 21-yard field goal. The Bears would get a comeback drive going as they got inside San Francisco's redzone, yet safety Michael Lewis got the game-ending interception, which preserved the four-point lead. With their four-game losing streak snapped, the 49ers improved to 4-5.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many is the difference in the yards of the TD run by Gore and the yards of the field goal made by Nedney?",
