From the table, I subtracted the initial number of volunteers (5,000) from the total number of volunteers (17,000) to get the number of additional volunteers who signed up after February 2014. Therefore, the answer is 12,000.\n\nTo solve the problem better, it would have been helpful to have the exact percentage of volunteers who signed up after February 2014.

Volunteer recruitment began in late 2013, and by February 2014, about 5,000 volunteers have signed up. This number swelled to over 17,000 by February 2015, and a volunteers night event was held at Universal Studios Singapore to launch the sports volunteers brand name as \"Team Nila\" and to thank the volunteers who have signed up with free shows at the venue. Amongst the pool of 17,000 volunteers, 35% came from the community, while 65% were from corporations in support of the games.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more volunteers signed up after the initial 5000 in February 2014?",
