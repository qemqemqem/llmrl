    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their last-second loss to the Colts, the Chargers stayed at home for a Week 13 interconference duel with the Atlanta Falcons.  In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Falcons kicker Jason Elam got a 35-yard field goal.  The 'Bolts would strike back as RB LaDainian Tomlinson got a 3-yard TD run (which was his 136th career TD, tying him with Marshall Faulk for fifth all-time).  Atlanta answered with Elam making a 40-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Falcons took the lead as QB Matt Ryan completed an 18-yard TD pass to former Chargers TE Justin Peelle, along with Atlanta's defense forcing QB Philip Rivers to commit intentional grounding from his own endzone, giving the Falcons a safety. In the third quarter, San Diego began to charge back as safety Eric Weddle returned a fumble 86 yards for a touchdown (with a failed two-point conversion).  In the fourth quarter, Atlanta began to pull away as Ryan completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Harry Douglas.  The Chargers tried to come back as kicker Nate Kaeding nailed a 28-yard field goal.  However, the Falcons' defense prevented any possible comeback. With the loss, the Chargers fell to 4-8. This was San Diego's seventh loss by one possession.\n\nQuestion:\nHow did the Chargers score in the third quarter?",
