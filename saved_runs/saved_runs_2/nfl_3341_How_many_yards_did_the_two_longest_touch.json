I then added the yardage of the two touchdowns together, which gave me a total of 55 yards. \n\nSince this was a straightforward problem, there was not much room for improvement in terms of solving it. However, if the problem had been more complex, I could have used a table or a diagram to organize the information and make it easier to identify the two longest touchdowns and add their yardage together.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn week 11, the Lions visited their division rival, the Chicago Bears. The Bears scored 10 points in the first quarter via a 23-yard field goal from Connor Barth, and a one-yard touchdown pass from Mitchell Trubisky to Adam Shaheen. The Lions scored 21 points in the second quarter via a 27-yard fumble return from D. J. Hayden, a 28-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Marvin Jones Jr. and a two-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Ameer Abdullah. The Bears responded with a 12-yard touchdown run from Jordan Howard, to make the score 21-17 in favor of Detroit at half-time. After a scoreless third quarter, the Lions extended their lead in the fourth quarter via a 27-yard field goal from Matt Prater. The Bears responded with a 15-yard touchdown run from Tarik Cohen to tie the game. The Lions regained the lead via a 52-yard field goal from Prater. The Bears attempted comeback failed when Barth missed a potentially game-tying 46-yard field goal attempt with eight seconds remaining in the game, making the final score 27-24 in favor of Detroit. With the win, the Lions won all of their division games on the road in a season for the first time in franchise history.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did the two longest touchdowns combine for?",
