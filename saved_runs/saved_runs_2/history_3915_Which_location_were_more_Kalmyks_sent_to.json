    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe deportation was given the code name Operation Ulusy. In it, a total of 93,139 Kalmyks were uprooted. They were packed into Cattle wagon and dispatched in some 46 trains. One witness recalled that they traveled for two weeks. Many Kalmyks were dirty and unwashed upon arrival; upon exiting, the snow became black from their dirt. The deportation was completed on 31 December. A majority of them (91,919) were deported by the end of the year, though an additional 1,014 people were also evicted in January 1944. Resolution no. 1432 425 of the Soviet of Peoples Commissars, which determined that this ethnic group should be resettled, was adopted on 28 December 1943 and signed by Vyacheslav Molotov, but not made public. The entire operation was guided by the NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria and his Deputy Commissar Ivan Serov. Other officials who participated in it included Victor Grigorievich Nasedkin, Head of the Gulag and Commissar of the State Security of the 3rd degree, and Dmitri Vasilevich Arkadiev, the Head of the Transport Department of the USSR NKVD. The Kalmyks were sent to various locations in Siberia\u2014by January 1944, 24,352 were sent to the Omsk Oblast, 21,164 to Krasnoyarsk Krai, 20,858 to Altai Krai, and 18,333 to Novosibirsk Oblast. Alternative sources indicate that, beginning in 1944, 6,167 Kalmyk families were in the Altai, 7,525 in the Krasnoyarsk, 5,435 in Novosibirsk and 8,353 in the Omsk Region. 660 families were also located in the Tomsk Region, 648 in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, 522 in Tobolsk, 2,796 in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and 1,760 in the  Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich location were more Kalmyks sent to in Siberia by January 1944, Krasnoyarsk Krai or Altai Krai?",
