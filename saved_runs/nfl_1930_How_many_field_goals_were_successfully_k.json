    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Vikings began the 2010 NFL season by taking part in the annual NFL Kickoff Game against the defending Super Bowl champions, the New Orleans Saints, in a rematch of the previous season's NFC Championship Game. Minnesota lost the coin toss and gave up a touchdown on the first drive of the game; New Orleans received the ball from the kickoff and then took 5 plays to go 77 yards, culminating with Drew Brees passing 29 yards down the right sideline for WR Devery Henderson, who dived into the endzone for the score. The 1st quarter ended with the Vikings defense forcing the Saints to go 3-and-out, with the subsequent punt beginning the 2nd quarter. The Vikings began the next drive at their own 11-yard line, before taking 16 plays to go 66 yards and into field goal range. They failed to convert on 3rd down at the New Orleans 23-yard line, giving Ryan Longwell the chance to score a 41-yard field goal. Minnesota forced another 3-and-out on the Saints' next possession, but Bernard Berrian muffed the catch on the punt return, and the Vikings began their next drive at their own 18-yard line. To rub salt in the wound, on the 3rd play of the drive, Brett Favre was hit hard by Roman Harper and he threw a pass right into the hands of Saints MLB Jonathan Vilma. With less than 90 seconds left in the half, Garrett Hartley stepped up for a 46-yard field goal attempt, but he hooked the kick wide left of the uprights. Beginning at the 36-yard line with 1:19 left in the half, Favre controlled the clock and picked up a 1st down before throwing consecutive 33-yard and 20-yard passes to TE Visanthe Shiancoe for the Vikings' first touchdown of the season. Ryan Longwell's extra point attempt was blocked by DT Remi Ayodele, but the Vikings went in at the half with a 2-point lead. After receiving the ball to start the second half, the Vikings were unable to get past midfield and gave the ball back to the Saints on the New Orleans 26-yard line. In the space of 10 plays, the Saints were up to the Minnesota 1-yard line, from where Pierre Thomas was able to jump over the line of scrimmage to restore New Orleans' lead. In the 4th quarter, the Saints had another shot at a field goal, this time from 32 yards, but again Hartley pulled the kick wide of the posts. New Orleans got the ball back with 5:32 left in the game, and ran out the clock to claim a 14-9 win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals were successfully kicked in the game?",
