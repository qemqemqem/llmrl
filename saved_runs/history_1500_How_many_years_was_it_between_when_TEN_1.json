To solve the problem, I subtracted the year of the move from the year of the previous location for each of the two moves and added the results together to get the total number of years between the two locations. However, I did not take into account that the question was asking for the number of years between the two moves, not the total number of years between all three locations. To solve the problem better, I should have focused on the specific time period between the two moves and calculated the difference in years accordingly.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nTEN-10's broadcast facilities have been in the inner city suburb of Pyrmont since 1997. These studios feature a large open plan newsroom and news-set where all Ten's national and local Sydney news bulletins are produced. This facility is also the network's head office and broadcasts the network signal to other cities. When TEN-10 opened in 1965, it operated from newly built studio facilities at North Ryde, these were sold in the 1990s when the network underwent financial turmoil. The North Ryde complex, which was used by Global Television in recent years, was demolished in September 2007.  Following the move from North Ryde in 1990, TEN relocated to a small warehouse in Ultimo, followed by their final move to the new studios in Pyrmont in May 1997. Most series are produced on location or at external studios by external companies, but a few programs are made in-house by TEN.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years was it between when TEN-10's broadcast facilities have been in the inner suburb of Pyrmont and the move from North Ryde?",
