    "problem_text": "Context:\nStill searching for their first win of the year, the Rams went home for a Week 5 divisional duel with the Arizona Cardinals.  With QB Marc Bulger out with an injured rib cage, back-up QB Gus Frerotte got the start.  In the first quarter, St. Louis took the early lead with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 46-yard field goal.  The Cardinals would tie the game with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 50-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Rams regained the lead with Frerotte completing a 16-yard TD pass to WR Drew Bennett.  However, Arizona tied the game with RB Edgerrin James fumbling at the 1-yard line and OG Reggie Wells recovering the ball in the end zone.  Afterwards, St. Louis regained the lead with Wilkins kicking a 35-yard field goal.  However, the Cardinals took the lead prior to halftime with QB Kurt Warner getting a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Rams regained the lead with Frerotte completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt.  Afterwards, Arizona tied the game with Rackers nailing a 32-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, St. Louis continued its struggles with Cardinals CB Roderick Hood returning an interception 68&#160;yards for a touchdown.  The Rams would answer with Wilkins getting a 31-yard field goal, but the Cardinals increased its lead with Warner completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Larry Fitzgerald.  St. Louis tried to come back as Frerotte completed a 29-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael, along with Frerotte's 2-point conversion pass to Holt.  Unfortunately, Arizona held on to win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Neil Racker's first quarter field goal kick compared to Jeff Wilkin's first quarter field goal kick?",
