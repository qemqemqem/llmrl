    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off of the bye week, the Steelers traveled to Baltimore to take on their division rival Ravens. The game received much hype, including QB Ben Roethlisberger returning from injury. Through the first half it was all Ravens when Joe Flacco found Mike Wallace on a 95-yard touchdown pass to move up 7-0 in the first quarter. This was followed by Justin Tucker's 49-yard field goal in the second to make it 10-0 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Ravens went back to work as Tucker went for a 42-yard field goal to make it 13-0. In the fourth quarter, Chris Moore blocked a punt and returned it 14 yards for a touchdown with a (successful two-point conversion) to make it 21-0. Later on in the game, the Steelers finally got on the board as Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 23-yard touchdown pass making the score 21-7. They wrapped up the scoring later on when Roethlisberger ran for a touchdown himself from 4 yards out making the final score 21-14. With their third straight loss, the Steelers fell to 4-4 and move into a tie with the Ravens for the lead in the AFC North. The loss was also the Steelers' fourth straight loss to the Ravens as well as the fourth straight year losing to their top division rivals in Baltimore.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards in all did Justin Tucker kick in the game?",
