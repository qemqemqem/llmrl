    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Texans' ninth match was an AFC South rivalry match against the Jaguars at EverBank Field. In the first quarter the Texans trailed early as kicker Josh Scobee hit a 38-yard field goal. They replied after kicker Neil Rackers made a 24-yard field goal. They trailed again in the 2nd quarter with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 3 and a 9-yard TD run. However, the lead didn't last long after RB Arian Foster got a 1-yard TD run, and QB Matt Schaub threw a 9-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson. The Jaguars stayed in the lead when QB David Garrard completed a 52-yard TD pass to TE Zach Miller, but the Texans replied again with Schaub finding WR Kevin Walter on an 18-yard TD pass. Suddenly, the Texans' defense broke through with only a few seconds remaining after Garrard made a 50-yard TD pass to WR Mike Thomas. The ball was batted into his hands by Texans Defensive back Glover Quin, who made an attempt to bat the ball to the ground.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest touchdown run?",
