    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye week, the Vikings played a Week 9 interconference duel at home against the Houston Texans. In the first quarter, the Vikes drew first blood as RB Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run. The Texans responded with CB Jacques Reeves returning an interception 44&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Minnesota responded with QB Gus Frerotte completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice and a 49-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian. In the third quarter, Houston started to rally as QB Sage Rosenfels completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR David Anderson. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings answered with Frerotte completing a 25-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe. The Texans tried to come back as Rosenfels completed a 14-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson. Fortunately, Minnesota's defense stiffened for the victory.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns did Gus Frerotte throw in the game?",
