This includes a natural decrease since the last census of 3,296 people (that is 108,292 births minus 111,588 deaths) and an increase from net Human migration of 14,209 people into the state. West Virginia is the least populous Southeastern United States. Immigration to the United States from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 3,691 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 10,518 people.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many people made up the estimated population of West Virginia in 2000?",
