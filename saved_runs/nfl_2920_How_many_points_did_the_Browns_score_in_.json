The Browns scored two more touchdowns to go up 20-7.  The Cardinals drove into the red zone, but Fitzgerald turned the ball over.  After the Browns went 3 and out, the Cardinals drove down the field and kicked a field goal to cut the deficit to 20-10 heading into halftime.  The Cardinals dominated the second half.  They scored 14 unanswered to go up 24-20 heading into the 4th quarter.  The Cardinals committed a turnover on their own 20 yard line late in the third quarter, but McCown threw an interception into the endzone on the Browns' next drive.  The Cardinals scored another touchdown on their next drive, going up 31-20.  After the Browns turned it over, the Cardinals kicked a field goal to make it 34-20.  With QB Josh McCown injured, backup Johnny Manziel entered the game on the Browns' final drive.  However, the Browns were able to gain only one first down before turning it over on downs and effectively ending the game.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Browns score in total?",
