    "problem_text": "Context:\nFollowing their victory against the Packers, the Bears returned home to play the Minnesota Vikings. The Bears' return specialist Devin Hester allowed the Bears to take a lead by returning a punt 89 yards for a touchdown. However, Tarvaris Jackson tied the game by throwing a 60-yard touchdown pass to Troy Williamson. Brian Griese threw a 39-yard touchdown to Bernard Berrian that helped the Bears regain the lead, but Minnesota running back Adrian Peterson helped the Vikings gain control of the game by scoring rushing touchdowns of 67, 73, and 35 respectively. With roughly two and a half minutes left on the clock, Griese threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Muhsin Muhammad and later an 81-yard touchdown pass to Hester. The two touchdowns tied the game, but Ryan Longwell kicked a 55-yard field goal in the game's final seconds. With the loss, the Bears dropped to 2-4.
