    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Panthers, the Cardinals flew to the Edward Jones Dome for a Week 9 NFC West duel with the St. Louis Rams. In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early as Rams QB Marc Bulger completed an 80-yard TD pass to WR Derek Stanley. In the second quarter, the Cardinals took flight as Safety Antrel Rolle returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown, kicker Neil Rackers got a 36-yard field goal, rookie RB Tim Hightower got a 30-yard TD run, and former Rams QB Kurt Warner completed a 56-yard TD pass to WR Jerheme Urban. In the third quarter, the Cardinals continued their domination as Warner completed a seven-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin. In the fourth quarter, St. Louis tried to rally as Bulger completed a three-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt (with a failed two-point conversion.) Fortunately, Arizona pulled away as Rackers nailed a 30-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes did Warner throw?",
