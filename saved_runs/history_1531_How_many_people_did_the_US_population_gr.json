To solve the problem, I subtracted the population in 1860 from the population in 1900: 76 million - 32 million = 44 million. However, I forgot to account for the fact that the question asked for the growth in population, not the total population in 1900. To solve the problem correctly, I should have subtracted the population in 1860 from the population in 1900: 76 million - 32 million = 44 million, or 44,000,000. In the future, I will make sure to read the question more carefully and double-check my calculations to avoid making similar mistakes.",

    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe diplomatic history of the United States oscillated among three positions: isolation from diplomatic entanglements of other  nations ; alliances with European and other military partners; and unilateralism, or operating on its own sovereign policy decisions. The US always was large in terms of area, but its population was small, only 4 million in 1790.  Population growth was rapid, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 316 million in 2013.  Economic growth in terms of overall GDP was even faster. However, the nation's military strength was quite limited  in peacetime before 1940.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many people did the US population grow by between 1860 and 1900?",
