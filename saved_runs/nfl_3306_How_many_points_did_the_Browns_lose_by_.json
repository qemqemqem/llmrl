The Ravens scored the first quarter's only points when Justin Tucker kicked a 31-yard field goal to make it 3-0.  In the second quarter, the Browns took the lead when Duke Johnson Jr. ran for a 12-yard touchdown to make it 7-3.  Though, the Ravens moved back into the lead when Joe Flacco ran for a 2-yard touchdown followed up by Flacco finding Benjamin Watson on a 33-yard pass to make it 10-7 and then 17-7.  Zane Gonzalez got the Browns within a touchdown when he kicked a 45-yard field goal to make it 17-10 at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Ravens scored the second half's only 10 points to eventually seal the game when Brandon Williams recovered a fumble for a 1-yard touchdown to make it 24-10.  Tucker then hit a 43-yard field goal. The Ravens routed the Browns 27-10, sending them to their 15th consecutive loss and their 16th consecutive loss within the division.  The loss ensured that the Browns would finish the season without a home victory for the first time since the 1999 season.  With the loss, the Browns fell to 0-14 and became the first franchise to start 0-14 in consecutive seasons.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Browns lose by?",
