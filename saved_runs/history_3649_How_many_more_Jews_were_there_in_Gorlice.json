There are statistics on the Jewish population from 1880 to 1910 though.  Looking first at the Gorlice district in 1880 there was a total of 74,072 residents and out of those 6.4% (4,755) were Jews.  Just in the city of Gorlice itself, there were 2,257 jews out of the around 5,000 residents of the city which is close to 50%.  The population of Jews in Gorlice grew to 7.5% of the Gorlice district composed of Jews in 1910 and 51% of residents in the City of Gorlice were Jewish at that time (3,495 out of 6,600).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more Jews were there in Gorlice in 1910 than in 1880?",
