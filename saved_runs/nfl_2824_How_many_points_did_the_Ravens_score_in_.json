The Ravens scored first in the first quarter when Joe Flacco found Owen Daniels on a 2-yard TD pass for a 7-0 lead.  They increased their lead in the 2nd quarter as Justin Tucker nailed a 30-yard field goal for a 10-0 lead.  The Steelers finally got on the board when Shaun Suisham kicked a 25-yard field goal for a 10-3 game at halftime.  Returning after the break, the Steelers went back to work and were able to move down the field for Suisham to kick another field goal from 43 yards out to come within 4 with for a 10-6 game.  However, the Ravens started to take control later on when Flacco found Daniels again on a 1-yard TD pass making the score 17-6.  In the 4th quarter, the Ravens sealed the game with 3 field goals kicked by Tucker from 23, 22, and 20 yards out for a 20-6, 23-6, and 26-6 final score. The Steelers were held without a touchdown in a game for the first time since their 20-3 loss to the 49ers in 2011.  The team dropped to 1-1.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Ravens score in the second quarter?",
