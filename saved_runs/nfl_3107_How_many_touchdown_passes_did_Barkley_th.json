    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe week fifteen matchup between the Bears and Packers featured a forecast weather of 1&#160;&#176;F (&#8722;17&#160;&#176;C) with 15 miles per hour (24&#160;km/h) winds, the coldest game in Chicago. The previous record was 2&#160;&#176;F (&#8722;17&#160;&#176;C) in a Bears-Packers game in 2008, won by the Bears. The game ultimately featured temperatures of 11&#160;&#176;F (&#8722;12&#160;&#176;C). Chicago's rushing unit took on a Green Bay defense that was ranked sixth in rushing plays of at least ten yards with 30, and fourth in average first down rushing yards with 3.72 yards. Additionally, the Packers run defense was one of thirteen teams in the NFL to allow less than 100 yards per game, while also forcing 44 runs for negative yards, the fifth-most in the league. Despite this success, Jeff Joniak stated the Bears should utilize Jordan Howard, as the Bears averaged five rushing yards on first-down, while Howard recorded most than three yards after contact and only 9.8 percent of his runs had resulted in negative yards. Regarding Chicago's defense, Joniak wrote it should \"remain wary of  Rodgers\", who led the league in touchdown passes with 32 and threw only eight interceptions. On third down, the Packers offense ranked second with a 47.1 percent conversion rate. According to Joniak, the primary intangible of the game would be the 'scout's eye\", as scouts would be using the last three games of the season to evaluate players, as those \"who continue to compete with passion and toughness will earn high marks for not allowing the adversity of the season, the playing conditions or circumstances dictate the extent to which they invest themselves.\" The Packers opened the game with a score on the opening drive courtesy of Ty Montgomery's four-yard run. After three drives that ended with punts, the Packers were threatening to enter the Bears' red zone when Rodgers was sacked by Pernell McPhee to force a turnover on downs. Connor Barth kicked a 26-yard field goal and the Bears took the lead later in the second quarter when Matt Barkley threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Josh Bellamy. The Packers tied the game with Mason Crosby's 34-yard field goal. On the last play of the first half, Barkley's Hail Mary pass was intercepted by Micah Hyde. From there, the Bears began to struggle; Barkley was strip-sacked by Julius Peppers and was later intercepted by Ha Ha Clinton-Dix. As a result, the Packers scored 20 unanswered points off Crosby's 18-yard field goal, Montgomery and Christine Michael's runs of three and 42 yards, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the Bears began to rally when Barkley threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery, followed by Howard's nine-yard touchdown run. Barth tied the game at 27-27 with a 22-yard field goal. However, Rodgers threw a 60-yard pass to Jordy Nelson, which set up Crosby's game-winning 32-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes did Barkley throw in the second half?",
