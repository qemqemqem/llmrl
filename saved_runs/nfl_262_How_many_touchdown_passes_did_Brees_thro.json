    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye week, the Saints stayed at home for their Week 8 fight with the visiting Baltimore Ravens.  From the get-go, New Orleans trailed as quarterback Steve McNair got a 5-yard touchdown run for the only score of the quarter.  In the second quarter, things only got worse for the Saints, as McNair completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to WR Clarence Moore, while rookie DB Ronnie Prude returned an interception 12 yards for a touchdown.  New Orleans would get on the board, as quarterback Drew Brees completed a 32-yard touchdown pass to WR Joe Horn, yet Baltimore would increase their lead with McNair completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to TE Todd Heap.  In the third quarter, the Ravens got another 12-yard touchdown interception return with rookie Strong Safety Dawan Landry making the pick for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Saints tried to mount a comeback, as Brees completed a 47-yard touchdown pass and a 25-yard touchdown pass to rookie WR Marques Colston.  However, the Saints comeback drive would end there, as New Orleans fell to 5-2.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes did Brees throw in the fourth quarter?",
