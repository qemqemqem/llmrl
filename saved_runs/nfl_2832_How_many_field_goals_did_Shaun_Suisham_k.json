The Jets scored in the first quarter when Nick Folk scored a 23-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  This was followed by 2 touchdowns by the Jets as Michael Vick found T.J. Graham and Jace Amaro on 67-yard and 5-yard TDs for scores of 10-0 and 17-0.  The Steelers got on the board before halftime as Shaun Suisham nailed a 53-yard field goal for a 17-3 halftime score.  In the 3rd quarter, the Jets went back to work as Folk scored a 30-yard field goal for a 20-3 game.  The Steelers would then score 10 points in the 4th quarter:  Suisham's 27-yard field goal to get within 2 TDs followed by Ben Roethlisberger hooking up with Martavis Bryant on an 80-yard TD pass to come within a TD.  The Jets got the ball back and Vick took knees to end the game with a final score of 20-13.With the loss, the Steelers dropped to 6-4. The Jets had forced 4 takeaways against the Steelers.
