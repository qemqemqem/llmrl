In the first quarter, the G-Men trailed early as Bengals kicker Shayne Graham kicked a 22-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New York responded with RB Brandon Jacobs getting a 1-yard TD run.  Cincinnati replied with RB Chris Perry getting a 25-yard TD run, yet the Giants managed to tie the game with kicker John Carney getting a 24-yard field goal.  The Bengals ended the first half with Graham's 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Big Blue responded with Carney's 46-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants took the lead with Carney kicking a 26-yard field goal.  Cincinnati took the lead again with QB Carson Palmer completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh.  New York reclaimed the lead with QB Eli Manning completing a 4-yard TD pass to TE Kevin Boss, yet the Bengals tied the game with Graham's 21-yard field goal.  In overtime, Carney gave the Big Blue a big win with a game-winning 22-yard field goal. With the win, the Giants entered the bye week at 3-0.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals over 25 yards were scored?",
