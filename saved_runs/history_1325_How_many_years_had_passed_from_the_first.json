The Crimean campaigns took place in 1687 and 1689, while the Azov campaigns took place in 1695 and 1696. To find the time elapsed between the first Crimean campaign and the last Azov campaign, I subtracted the year of the first campaign from the year of the last campaign: 1696 - 1687 = 9. Therefore, the time elapsed between the first Crimean campaign and the last Azov campaign is 9 years.\n\nTo solve the problem better, I could have used a timeline to visualize the years of each campaign and the time elapsed between them.
