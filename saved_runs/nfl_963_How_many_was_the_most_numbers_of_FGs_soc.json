This game would also be WR Steve Smith's first game of the year, coming off his 2-game suspension. In the first quarter, Carolina got the early lead with kicker John Kasay getting a 43-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Panthers increased their lead with rookie RB Jonathan Stewart getting a 2-yard TD run.  The Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell's 28-yard field goal and CB Antoine Winfield returning a fumble 19 yards for a touchdown.  In the third quarter, Minnesota took the lead with QB Gus Frerotte completing a 34-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe.  In the fourth quarter, the Vikings sealed the win with Longwell nailing a 32-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many was the most numbers of FGs socred in any quarter?",
