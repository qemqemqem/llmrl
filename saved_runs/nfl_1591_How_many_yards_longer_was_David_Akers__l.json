Philadelphia took flight in the first quarter with wide receiver DeSean Jackson's 67-yard touchdown run and linebacker Will Witherspoon (recently acquired from the Rams) returning an interception 9 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the Eagles increased their lead with a 47-yard field goal from kicker David Akers.  The Redskins would get on the board with quarterback Jason Campbell completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Devin Thomas, yet Philadelphia answered with Akers nailing a 44-yard field goal and quarterback Donovan McNabb completing a 57-yard touchdown pass to Jackson.  Washington would close out the half with a 47-yard field goal from kicker Shaun Suisham. In the third quarter, both defenses fought back and forth and the period ended with no points. In the fourth and final quarter, Jason Campbell completed a one-yard touchdown pass to tight end Fred Davis for the only score of the second half The Eagles defense held on and, with the win, Philadelphia improved to 4-2.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was David Akers' longest field goal than his shortest?",
