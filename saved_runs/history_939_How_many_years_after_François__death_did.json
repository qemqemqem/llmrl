    "problem_text": "Context:\nFran\u00e7ois, Madeleine's father, died on 16 February 1700, and his pension of 1000 livres was transferred to Madeleine due to her leadership in 1692, on the condition that she provide for her mother. Madeleine managed Verch\u00e8res until her marriage in September 1706 to Pierre-Thomas Tarieu de La P\u00e9rade, who was a lieutenant in the regular troops of New France.  He was the son of Thomas de Lanougu\u00e8re, an administrator of the colony who descended from an old noble family in France.  The couple moved to Sainte-Anne-de-la-P\u00e9rade, Quebec, where Tarieu was co-seigneur.  Madeleine's seigneury at Verch\u00e8res was transferred to her new husband.  The complex land titles led to numerous lawsuits over the course of her life, and Madeleine sailed to France at least three times to represent herself and her husband in court. Marie-Madeleine died at Sainte-Anne-de-la-P\u00e9rade on 8 August 1747 at age 69.  She was buried beneath her pew at Sainte-Anne-de-la-P\u00e9rade.  Pierre-Thomas died 26 January 1757 at age 79.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many years after Fran\u00e7ois' death did Marie-Madeleine get married?",
