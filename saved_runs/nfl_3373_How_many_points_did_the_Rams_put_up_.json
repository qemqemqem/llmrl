    "problem_text": "Context:\nThis game turned out to be a shutout/blowout victory for the Los Angeles Rams in their second NFL International Series game at Twickenham Stadium against the Arizona Cardinals, Jared Goff threw for 235 yards and had 1 touchdown with only 1 interception, Todd Gurley had his fourth-100 yard game with 106 yards, 4.8 average, 4 receptions, and 1 touchdown, Cooper Kupp had 4 receptions, 51 yards, 12.8 average, and an 18-yard touchdown, and Greg Zuerlein completed 4 field goals. The Rams defense shut down Adrian Peterson for the game and prevented any points scored by the Cardinals offense as they had multiple drives which resulted in punts, a missed field goal, and 2 interceptions by the Rams defense (Lamarcus Joyner and Mark Barron respectively), the Cardinals failed to score any points throughout the game. Carson Palmer was injured and did not come back for the rest of the game and Drew Stanton had to start for the rest of the game, Both Palmer and Stanton were sacked once by the Rams defense (Aaron Donald and Ethan Westbrooks respectively) and had at least one interception, Stanton fumbled the ball which was recovered by a Cardinals center for 4th down. The Cardinals defense allowed the Rams offense to gain 425 yards, 3 touchdowns, and 4 field goals on 6 of their possessions. This game was also the Cardinals first blowout loss since 2012 (a 58-0 loss against the Seattle Seahawks) and was the Rams first shutout victory since 2014 (when they had two wins over the Oakland Raiders and the Washington Redskins both ending in shutout). With the win, the Rams advance into the bye at 5-2 for the first time 2003 sitting firmly atop the NFC West first place. They also improved on their record from last season.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points did the Rams put up?",
