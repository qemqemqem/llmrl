    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their win over the Texans, the Vikings stayed at home for a Week 10 NFC North rematch with the Green Bay Packers. In the first quarter, the Vikes drew first blood as QB Gus Frerotte completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. The Packers would respond with RB Ryan Grant getting a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Minnesota increased their lead with kicker Ryan Longwell (former Packer) getting a 54-yard field goal, along with the Vikings picking up back-to-back safeties. The first one came when QB Aaron Rodgers committed intentional grounding in his own endzone, with the second one coming from DE Jared Allen sacking Rodgers in his own endzone. Green Bay would close out the half with kicker Mason Crosby getting a 47-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes increased their lead as Frerotte completed a 47-yard TD pass to RB Chester Taylor. However, the Packers took the lead as safety Nick Collins returned an interception 59&#160;yards for a touchdown, along with CB/KR Will Blackmon returning a punt 65&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Packers increased their lead as Crosby nailed a 40-yard field goal. The Vikings regained the lead as RB Adrian Peterson got a 29-yard TD run. Green Bay did manage to get a late drive going, yet Crosby's 52-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right, preserving head coach Brad Childress' first win over the Packers.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did frerotte complete?",
