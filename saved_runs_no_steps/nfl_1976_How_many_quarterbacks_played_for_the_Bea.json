    "problem_text": "Context:\nThis Sunday night featured the introduction of the Giants' Ring of Honor, which included 30 historic players, coaches, and administrators. The presence of such defensive greats as Jessie Armstead and Michael Strahan in the stadium that night is credited with inspiring Perry Fewell's struggling defensive squad. The New York defense held the Bears to zero points, two first downs, and 22 yards of total offense in the first half, and sacked Jay Cutler nine times before knocking him out of the game with a concussion. In total, the Bears put together only six first downs (one by penalty) and finished with the lowest final score of any Giants visitor since the Eagles in 2007. The Bears went on to lose backup quarterback Todd Collins to a hard Michael Boley tackle; third-string quarterback Caleb Hanie was called upon to play the fourth quarter. Justin Tuck and Osi Umenyiora were each responsible for three sacks on the night. Manning and the Giants offense had their own difficulties putting points on the board, but second-half touchdowns by Bradshaw and Jacobs proved enough to win this defensive struggle. Nicks also had a notable day, catching eight passes for 110 yards.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many quarterbacks played for the Bears?",
