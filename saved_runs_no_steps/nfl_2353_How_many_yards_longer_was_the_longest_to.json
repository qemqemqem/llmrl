    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns traveled to Baltimore to take on the Ravens on Thursday Night Football. After a scoreless first quarter, the Ravens scored first in the second quarter as Joe Flacco found Torrey Smith on an 18-yard touchdown pass (with a failed PAT) for a 6-0 lead. The team increased their lead as Justin Tucker made a 45-yard field goal to make the score 9-0. Finally, the Browns scored not long before halftime when Trent Richardson ran for a 2-yard touchdown, making the halftime score 9-7. After the break, the Ravens went right back to work as Flacco used a QB sneak 1-yard run for a 16-7 lead. However, The Browns drew within 6 points as Phil Dawson nailed a 51-yard field goal, making the score 16-10. But then, the Ravens pulled away as Cary Williams picked off Weeden and returned the ball 63 yards for a touchdown, making the score 23-10. In the fourth quarter, the Browns tried to come back as Dawson nailed two field goals from 50 and 52 yards out making the score 23-13 and then 23-16, respectively. However, the Ravens took control of the game and the Browns' record dropped to 0-4 on the season, losing their 13th straight game against a division rival and their 9th straight game against the Ravens.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was the longest touchdown run than the shortest?",
