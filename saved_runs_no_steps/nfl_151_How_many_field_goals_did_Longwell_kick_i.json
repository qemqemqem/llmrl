    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a four-game skid, the Lions went home for an NFC North rematch with the Minnesota Vikings.  In the first quarter, the Lions trailed as Vikings RB Artose Pinner (a former Lion) got a 3-yard and a 4-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Detroit's struggles continued as Vikes QB Brad Johnson got a 3-yard TD run, yet the 2-point conversion failed.  Afterwards, the Lions finally got on the board with DB Jamar Fletcher returning an interception 88 yards for a touchdown, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 53-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Detroit held Minnesota to a 30-yard field goal by kicker Ryan Longwell, while Hanson kicked a 45-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Pinner wrapped things up for the Vikings with a 1-yard TD run.  Even though the Lions would get a touchdown, from QB Jon Kitna's 23-yard strike to RB Kevin Jones, Detroit was plagued with 6 turnovers.  They pulled within 10 in the 4th qtr and had a fourth and goal with less than four minutes to play. Needing two scores, inexplicably the Lions went for a touchdown and failed, thus killing any hope for a last minute victory. With their fifth-straight loss, the Lions fell to 2-11.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goals did Longwell kick in the third quarter?",
