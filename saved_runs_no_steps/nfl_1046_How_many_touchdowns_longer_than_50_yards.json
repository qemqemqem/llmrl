    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Lions went home for a Week 12 duel with another NFC South team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first quarter, Detroit struck first as QB Daunte Culpepper completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson.  The Lions continued their early success as safety Daniel Bullocks returned a fumble 44 yards for a touchdown, while kicker Jason Hanson got a 38-yard field goal. Although the 17-0 early advantage was the largest lead the Lions would obtain all year, it didn't even last until halftime.  In the second quarter, the Buccaneers' RB Warrick Dunn got a 13-yard TD run, while QB Jeff Garcia completed a 36-yard TD pass to WR Ike Hilliard and a 24-yard TD pass to TE Jerramy Stevens. In the third quarter, Tampa Bay added onto their lead as RB Clifton Smith returned a punt 70 yards for a touchdown, along with CB Ronde Barber returning an interception 65 yards for a touchdown.  Detroit scored when Hanson got a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, only the Buccaneers scored when kicker Matt Bryant nailed a 48-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdowns longer than 50 yards were scored?",
