    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye week, the Lions were at home and wearing their alternate uniforms for a Week 7 duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  In the first quarter, Detroit attacked first with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 34-yard field goal, along with RB Kevin Jones getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Buccaneers got on the board with QB Jeff Garcia completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Ike Hilliard.  Afterwards, the Lions ended the half with Hanson kicking a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Detroit increased its lead with Hanson nailing a 32-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Lions increased its lead with WR Calvin Johnson getting a 32-yard TD run.  Afterwards, Tampa Bay worked on a comeback as Garcia completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Maurice Stovall. Later, the Buccaneers would recover their onside kick and eventually turn it into kicker Matt Bryant's 48-yard field goal.  Fortunately, Detroit erased the Buccaneers' hopes of recovering another onside kick. With the win, the Lions improved to 4-2, and also surpassed their 2006 win total.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was the second touchdown compared to the first?",
