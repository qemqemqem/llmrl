    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off a disappointing home loss over the Falcons, the Redskins stayed at home for an NFC East rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles.  In the first quarter, Washington struck first with kicker Shaun Suisham nailing a 31-yard field goal.  However, the Eagles struck back with QB Jeff Garcia getting a 10-yard TD pass to TE L.J. Smith.  In the second quarter, things got worse for the Redskins as strong safety Michael Lewis returned an interception 84 yards for a touchdown, while Garcia hooked up with WR Donte' Stallworth on a 3-yard TD pass.  Afterwards, Suisham would kick a 45-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Washington started to come back with Suisham kicking a 32-yard field goal, while QB Jason Campbell completed a 34-yard TD pass to WR Antwaan Randle El.  However, in the fourth quarter, the only thing left of the Redskins' comeback was Suisham's 35-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Eagles' offense squashed any hope of a Washington comeback.  With the loss, the Redskins fell to 4-9 clinching last place in the NFC East. Stats\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Jason Campbell's TD pass to WR Antwaan Randle El.compared to Jeff Garcia's TD pass to TE L.J. Smith?",
