    "problem_text": "Context:\nObesity has quickly become a major health issue in Texas. In 2017, 33.6% of Texas adults were obese as compared to 29.9% of U.S. adults. In 2000 21.7% of adults were obese and in 1990 only 10.7% of adults were obese. In 2016, 33% of 10-17 year olds in Texas were obese. When separated out by gender, 34.6% of Texas females and 32.8% of Texas males were obese. When separated out by race, 31% of White adults, 41.7% of Black adults, and 37.8% of Hispanic adults were obese in Texas in 2016.Research shows that an increase in household income is correlated with a decrease in obesity rates. There are educational achievement patterns as well - 39% of the Texas population with less than a high school education was obese while only 23% of college graduates were obese. Living in a rural area in Texas is also correlated with higher obesity rates.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many percentage points of Texans were obese compared to US adults?",
