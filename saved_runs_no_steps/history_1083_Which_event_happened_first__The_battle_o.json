    "problem_text": "Context:\nHorn attacked the provinces Halland and Sk\u00e5ne in 1565 and made several attempts at Bohusl\u00e4n and Uddevalla. The Danish burned old L\u00f6d\u00f6se in the province of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland. Eric initially led the army against the Danish himself, but then turned over command to Nils Boije, who on 28 August 1564 took Varberg. The Danish army under Daniel Rantzau beat the Swedish army in the Battle of Axtorna on 20 October. The Swedes fared better at sea. Horn, commanding the Swedish navy, pursued a Danish-L\u00fcbeck fleet onto the German coast where most of it was destroyed. After this victory Horn steered for \u00d6resund and levied a toll on passing ships. On 4 June 1565, the Battle at Buchow took place on the Mecklenburg coast, in which the Danish-L\u00fcbeck commander Herluf Trolle was mortally wounded. In the Battle of 7 July 1565, the Swedish navy under Horn defeated a Danish-L\u00fcbeck navy under Otto Rud near Bornholm, where Sweden captured the Danish flagship the Jegermesther. Thus ensured the command of the eastern Baltic by the Swedes that year. In January 1566 Sweden unsuccessfully laid siege to Bohus Fortress in Bohusl\u00e4n . Daniel Rantzau then moved his forces into V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland. At sea Horn returned to taking toll charges in the Baltic. An indecisive battle at sea outside of \u00d6land occurred on 26 July 1566. On 28 July half the Danish-L\u00fcbeck Navy was lost in a storm at sea. Horn was then called to command troops on land, where he died 9 September.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich event happened first, The battle of Buchow or the battle of Axtorna?",
