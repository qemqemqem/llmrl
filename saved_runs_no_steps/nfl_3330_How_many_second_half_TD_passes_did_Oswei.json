    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Broncos spotted the Colts a 10-0 lead, with quarterback Jacoby Brissett rushing for a 7-yard touchdown, followed in the second quarter by a 45-yard field goal by placekicker Adam Vinatieri. The former occurred after an interception of quarterback Trevor Siemian on the Broncos' initial possession. Siemian was knocked out of the game late in the first quarter due to a shoulder injury, after being sacked by Colts' linebacker Barkevious Mingo. Brock Osweiler took over early in the second quarter, and got the Broncos on the scoreboard just before halftime, with an 18-yard touchdown run. A 39-yard field goal by Vinatieri on the Colts' initial possession of the second half increased the lead to 13-7; however, the Broncos' defense held the Colts scoreless for the remainder of the game. The Broncos claimed the lead for good with a pair of touchdown passes from Osweiler &#8212; a 22-yarder to wide receiver Cody Latimer, followed by a 54-yarder to tight end Jeff Heuerman (with a successful two-point conversion). Placekicker Brandon McManus added a 40-yard field goal with 5:18 remaining in the game, on a drive that chewed up 9:40 off the clock. It was the Broncos' only road win of the season. The Broncos snapped a 6-game losing streak in Indianapolis, dating back to 2003 (including the playoffs).\n\nQuestion:\nHow many second half TD passes did Osweiler throw?",
