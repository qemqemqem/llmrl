After a scoreless first quarter, Dallas trailed in the second quarter as Panthers quarterback Jake Delhomme completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dante Rosario.  The Cowboys took control in the third quarter as kicker Nick Folk nailed a 24-yard field goal, followed by running back Tashard Choice getting a 5-yard touchdown run.  Dallas pulled away with Folk's 19-yard field goal and cornerback Terence Newman returning an interception 27 yards for a touchdown (with Choice getting the 2-point conversion run).\n\nQuestion:\nWhich players scored touchdowns in the game?",
