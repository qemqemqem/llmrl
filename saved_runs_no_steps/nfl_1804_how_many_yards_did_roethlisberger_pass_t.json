    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their loss to the Falcons, the Browns flew to Heinz Field for a Week 6 AFC North duel with their archrival, the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Browns were forced to start third string rookie quarterback Colt McCoy as injuries sidelined Jake Delhomme and Seneca Wallace. Cleveland delivered the opening punch in the first quarter as kicker Phil Dawson made a 39-yard field goal, his 235th field goal as a Cleveland Brown which broke Lou Groza's franchise record.  The Steelers would take the lead in the second quarter as quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completed a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace. The Browns' deficit increased in the third quarter as Roethlisberger found wide receiver Hines Ward on an 8-yard touchdown pass.  Cleveland tried to rally as McCoy completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Benjamin Watson, but Pittsburgh would pull away with Roethlisberger's 14-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did roethlisberger pass to miller?",
