    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their road loss to the Bills, the Raiders went home for a Week 4 AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers.  In the first quarter, Oakland struck first as kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 22-yard goal, with Safety Gibril Wilson sacking Chargers QB Philip Rivers in his endzone for a safety.  In the second quarter, the Raiders increased their lead with QB JaMarcus Russell completing a 63-yard TD pass to TE Zach Miller, along with Janikowski kicking a 28-yard field goal. Just prior to halftime, Janikowski attempted to kick a 76-yard field goal, a full 13 yards longer than the NFL record and seven yards longer than the record at any level of gridiron football. Predictably, the kick fell well short, not even reaching the end zone (much less the goal posts), and the ball was picked up by Chargers cornerback Antonio Cromartie. In the third quarter, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding's 28-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, San Diego took the lead with Rivers' 9-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates and RB LaDainian Tomlinson's 13-yard TD run (along with a successful 2-point conversion pass from Rivers to RB Darren Sproles). Oakland tried to prevent another collapse as Janikowski got a 32-yard field goal. However, the Chargers sealed the win with Kaeding nailing a 47-yard field goal and Tomlinson getting a 41-yard TD run. With the loss, the Raiders went into their bye week at 1-3. The following Tuesday, Lane Kiffin was officially fired as head coach and was replaced by offensive line coach Tom Cable.\n\nQuestion:\nhow many yards did Tomlinson run?",
