    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Jets quickly drove downfield on their first possession, scoring their first touchdown in the first quarter all season. Chad Pennington found Jerricho Cotchery on a 28-yard completion and rookie running back Leon Washington picked up 23 yards on a sweep around end before Washington scored on a 5-yard touchdown run. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington fired a 44-yard touchdown pass to Justin McCareins, his first touchdown of the season, to open up a 14-0 lead. The Lions would get on the board early in the second quarter as Jon Kitna had big completions to Dan Campbell, Mike Furrey, and Roy Williams, the pass to Williams a 22-yard touchdown. But on the kickoff, Justin Miller returned the ball 56 yards inside Detroit territory, and after a pass from Pennington to Cotchery, Kevan Barlow scored on a 3-yard touchdown run. Kitna would get intercepted by Kerry Rhodes on the next possession, but Pennington would then get picked off by Terrence Holt at the Detroit 2-yard line to short-circuit a possible score. The Jets led 21-7 at halftime. Kitna would again get intercepted on the first possession of the second half, this time by Jonathan Vilma. But the drive went nowhere, and Detroit's next one, a 12-play, 83-yard drive, resulted in a 25-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Jets got that right back, as Pennington converted a couple of third downs during a drive that was capped by Mike Nugent's 33-yard field goal. Down fourteen points, Detroit halved New York's lead with Kitna finding Kevin Jones on a 9-yard touchdown pass on a drive where Kitna converted a critical 4th-and-11 pass to Mike Furrey. The Jets would come right back, with Washington scoring on a 16-yard touchdown run on a sweep around end. Detroit would not give up, as Kitna found Furrey on an 18-yard touchdown pass on a play that survived a Jets challenge. On that drive, Kitna again converted a fourth down to Furrey. But Detroit's ensuing onside kick failed, and the Jets ran out the clock.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards did the differential measure between the longest and shortest passing touchdown?",
