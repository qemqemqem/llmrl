    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Browns then traveled to take on the Bengals in Game 2 of the Battle of Ohio.  In the first quarter, the Browns took an early 3-0 lead when Zane Gonzalez kicked a 27-yard field goal.  Though, though the Bengals responded when Andy Dalton found Tyler Boyd on an 8-yard pass to make it 7-3.  In the second quarter, the Bengals increased their lead with 3 field goals kicked by Randy Bullock:  from 31, 49, and 21 yards out to make the score 10-3, 13-3, and 16-3.  The Browns made it 16-6 before halftime when Gonzalez kicked a 21-yard field goal.  The Bengals moved further ahead when Dalton found Tyler Kroft on a 1-yard pass to make it 23-6.  The Browns came within 2 touchdowns when Gonzalez kicked his third field goal of the day from 39 yards out to make it 23-9 in the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter, DeShone Kizer ran for a 3-yard touchdown to make it 23-16.  Though later on, the Bengals sealed the game when Joe Mixon ran for an 11-yard touchdown. The Browns' losing streak continued as they fell to the Bengals 30-16.  With the loss, the Browns fell to 0-11, losing their 12th consecutive game, their 18th consecutive road game, and their 15th consecutive divisional matchup, and combined with a Bills victory over the Chiefs, eliminated them from playoff contention. The loss ensured that the Browns would finish in 4th place in the AFC North for the 7th consecutive season.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team allowed the least first quarter points?",
