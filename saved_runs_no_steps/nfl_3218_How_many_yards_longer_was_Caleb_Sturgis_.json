    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Steelers traveled across the state to take on their in-state rival Eagles. In the first quarter, the Eagles drew first blood when Caleb Sturgis kicked a 29-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. In the second quarter, they increased their lead when Carson Wentz found Jordan Matthews on a 12-yard touchdown pass to increase their lead to 10-0. Chris Boswell then got the Steelers on the board when he kicked a 40-yard field goal making the score 10-3. Sturgis wrapped up the first half scoring with another field goal from 38 yards out to make it 13-3 at halftime. After the break, the Eagles got back to work in the third quarter as Wentz found Darren Sproles on a 73-yard touchdown pass to make it 20-3. This would be followed by 2 touchdowns: Wendell Smallwood ran for a 1-yard touchdown while Kenjon Barner ran for an 8-yard touchdown to make the score 27-3 and 34-3. With a scoreless fourth quarter, that would turn out to be the final score of the game. With the loss, the Steelers fell to 2-1 and second place in the AFC North. Roethlisberger's record also fell to 0-2 in Philadelphia and 2-2 against the Eagles. Tomlin's record fell to 1-2 against the Eagles. The team was also held without a touchdown in a game for the first time since their 26-6 loss against the Ravens during Week 2 in 2014.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards longer was Caleb Sturgis's second field goal compared to his first?",
