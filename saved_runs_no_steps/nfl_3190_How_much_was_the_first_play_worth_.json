Despite a tipped pass at the line of scrimmage in the fourth quarter being intercepted, the Giants defense held the Eagles to incompletions in the red zone allowing the Giants to improve 5-3 and beat the Eagles at MetLife for the first time since Week 17 of the 2012 season and the first win over the Eagles since Week 8 in the 2013 season. The Eagles had their own missed opportunities, going 0-2 in 4th-down conversions in Giants territory and another field goal was blocked. To date, this is the last time Manning threw for four touchdowns.\n\nQuestion:\nHow much was the first play worth?",
