    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their overtime road loss to the Browns, the Seahawks went home for an NFC West rematch on Monday Night Football with the San Francisco 49ers.  In the first quarter, Seattle took flight as QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Will Heller, along with kicker Josh Brown nailing a 20-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Seahawks increased their lead with RB Maurice Morris getting a 6-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle sealed the victory and the season-sweep in the fourth quarter with Hasselbeck completing a 10-yard TD pass. This would mark the third straight time that the Seahawks have shut out their opponent on Monday Night Football (5 overall). With the win, the Seahawks improved to 5-4 and swept the 49ers. Since 2001, Seattle has won 17 out of 21 contests at home against NFC West opponents.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many points were earned by the Sea hawks in the second quarter?",
