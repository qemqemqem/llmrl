    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye week, the Vikings flew to New Meadowlands Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the New York Jets on Monday night. Minnesota trailed early in the first quarter as Jets kicker Nick Folk got a 25-yard field goal. The Vikings' deficit increased in the second quarter as Folk made a 53-yard and a 22-yard field goal. Minnesota's frustrations continued in the third quarter as Folk got a 34-yard field goal. The Vikings would respond as quarterback Brett Favre threw his 500th career touchdown pass by finding wide receiver Randy Moss on a 37-yard touchdown pass, but New York answered with Folk's 31-yard field goal. After the delay at the end of the third quarter due to adverse weather conditions the Vikings would strike back in the fourth quarter as Favre found wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 34-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion), but the Jets replied with a 23-yard touchdown run from running back Shonn Greene. Minnesota tried to rally as Favre found Harvin again on an 11-yard touchdown pass, but New York would put the game away as cornerback Dwight Lowery returned an interception 26 yards for a touchdown.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many touchdown passes did Brett Favre have prior to the Week 5 game?",
