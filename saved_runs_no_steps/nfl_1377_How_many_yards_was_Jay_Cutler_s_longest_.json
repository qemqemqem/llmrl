    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their home win over the Steelers, the Bears flew to Qwest Field for a Week 3 duel with the Seattle Seahawks.  Chicago would trail in the first quarter as quarterback Seneca Wallace completed a 39-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones, followed by kicker Olindo Mare's 46-yard field goal.  Seattle would add onto their lead in the second quarter with Mare's 37-yard field goal, yet the Bears would answer with quarterback Jay Cutler's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Greg Olsen. Chicago would take the lead in the third quarter with Cutler's 7-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Johnny Knox, followed by kicker Robbie Gould's 37-yard field goal.  The Seahawks would reply in the fourth quarter with Mare's 39-yard and 46-yard field goal, yet the Bears would prevail as Cutler completed a 36-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Devin Hester, followed by a 2-point conversion pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett.  Afterwards, Chicago's defense would hold on for the win.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was Jay Cutler's longest touchdown pass?",
