    "problem_text": "Context:\nIn the early game the Giants were crushed by the Rams 31\u20133, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers dominated the Raiders, 38\u20137, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, making them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17\u201314 against the defending conference champion 1970 Minnesota Vikings season, thus setting up a matchup against the 1970 Dallas Cowboys season for the NFC championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at Kezar Stadium the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing, 17\u201310, thus giving the Cowboys their first conference championship. The 49ers sent five players to the 1970 Pro Bowl that season, including MVP veteran quarterback John Brodie, wide receiver Gene Washington (49ers), and linebacker Dave Wilcox. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season the 49ers moved from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.\n\nQuestion:\nIn the playoffs did the 49ers score more points against the Vikings or the Cowboys?",
