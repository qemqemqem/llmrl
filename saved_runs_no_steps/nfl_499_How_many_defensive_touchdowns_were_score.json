    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Panthers came home for an NFC South rematch with the Atlanta Falcons. Veteran QB Vinny Testaverde would get the start. In the first quarter, Carolina trailed early as Falcons RB Warrick Dunn getting a 30-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Panthers took the lead with CB Ken Lucas returning a fumble 27 yards for a touchdown, while kicker John Kasay managed to get a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Atlanta tied the game with kicker Morten Andersen getting a 36-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Falcons regained the lead with Andersen kicking a 47-yard field goal. Carolina would reply with Kasay nailing a 31-yard field goal. Unfortunately, Atlanta sealed the win with QB Joey Harrington completing a 30-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler. With the loss, not only did the Panthers fall to 4-5, but they even lost six-straight home games.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many defensive touchdowns were scored?",
