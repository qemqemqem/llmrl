    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to end their two-game skid, the 49ers went home for a Week 14 fight with the Green Bay Packers.  In the first quarter, the Niners got an early lead with kicker Joe Nedney nailing a 24-yard field goal, yet the Packers gained the lead with QB Brett Favre's 36-yard TD pass to WR Ruvell Martin.  In the second quarter, San Francisco's troubles grew as Packers kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 23-yard field goal, while RB Ahman Green got a 1-yard TD run.  The Niners would respond with Nedney kicking a 36-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, the 49ers had RB Frank Gore get a 1-yard TD run, yet Green Bay responded with Favre completing a 68-yard TD pass to WR Donald Driver.  In the fourth quarter, the Packers wrapped things up with Rayner kicking a 44-yard and a 21-yard field goal.  The Niners would get a touchdown, as QB Alex Smith completed a 52-yard TD pass to rookie TE Vernon Davis, yet a botched snap foiled the following PAT.  With their third-straight loss, the 49ers fell to 5-8.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many field goal attempts were successful for Packers kicker Dave Rayner?",
