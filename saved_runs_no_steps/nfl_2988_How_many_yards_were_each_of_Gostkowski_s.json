    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter a Titans three-and-out, the Patriots put together an 11 play, 79-yard drive, with Brady hitting Gronkowski on a 5-yard touchdown pass. Three possessions later, Akiem Hicks returned a Marcus Mariota fumble 14 yards for a touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 14-0. After another Titans punt, Amendola fumbled with Cody Riggs recovering at the Patriots 26. The Titans could only reach the Patriots 21, but Ryan Succop got the Titans on the board with a 49-yard field goal. Keshawn Martin returned the ensuing kick 75 yards to the Titans 30. Two plays later, Brady hit White for a 30-yard touchdown, widening the lead to 21-3. Zach Mettenberger replaced Mariota on the next drive, and the Titans drove to the Patriots 38, but on 4th-and-1, Antonio Andrews stuffed for no gain. The Patriots drove to the Titans 25 and Gostkowski increased the lead to 24-3 on a 43-yard field goal. Amendola returned the ensuing punt 22 yards to the Patriots 45. The Patriots drove to the Titans 30, but Gostkowski missed the 48-yard field goal wide right, keeping the score 24-3 at halftime. After the Patriots punted, aid by an 18-yard punt return by Harry Douglas, the Titans drove 59 yards in 7 plays, with Mettenberger finding Delanie Walker for a 7-yard touchdown, trimming the deficit to 24-10. The Patriots responded by driving to the Titans 20, and Gostkowski was good from 38 yards away. Three possessions later, the Titans reached the Patriots 36, but Mettenberger was intercepted by Butler at the 2. After a Patriots three-and-out, Mettenberger hit Walker again for a 57-yard touchdown pass, with a missed extra point, making the score just 27-16. The Patriots drove to the Titans 23, and Gostkowski upped the score to 30-16 with his 41-yard field goal. The Titans drove to the Patriots 48, but Mettenberger was intercepted by Collins who returned it 51 yards to the Titans 16. Four plays later, Gostkowski hit a 32-yarder, making the score 33-16. The Titans ran out the rest of the clock to end the game. With the win, the Patriots improved to 12-2, and they clinched a first-round bye following the Broncos' loss to the Steelers later that night.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards were each of Gostkowski's field goals?",
