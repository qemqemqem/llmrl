    "problem_text": "Context:\nLooking to secure a playoff berth, the Falcons traveled to Seattle in their last regular-season road game to take on the Seahawks. Seattle took an early lead with a 1-yard TD run by Marshawn Lynch. Atlanta would later respond early in the second quarter with a Matt Ryan 3-yard TD pass to Jason Snelling, with Matt Bryant later adding a 27-yard field goal to take the lead. Seattle tied the game with a 38-yard field goal from Olindo Mare; however, the Falcons took the lead again with a Ryan 24-yard TD pass to Michael Jenkins to close the first half. On the Seahawks' first offensive possession of the second half, Matt Hasselbeck fumbled the football in the end-zone with defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux recovering for a Falcons' touchdown. Atlanta would later add to their lead with a 25-yard Bryant field goal as well as a Ryan 24-yard TD pass to Roddy White. Seattle's only score of the second half came from backup quarterback Charlie Whitehurst with a 1-yard TD rush followed by a successful 2-point conversion with a Whitehurst pass to Ben Obomanu. With the win, Atlanta improved to 12-2. Also, the Falcons secured a playoff berth early in the game due to Philadelphia's victory over the New York Giants.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many is the difference in the number of yards of the TD run by Lynch and the second field goal made by Bryant?",
