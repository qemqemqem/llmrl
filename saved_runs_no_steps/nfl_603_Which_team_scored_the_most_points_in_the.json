    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their Monday Night road win over the Broncos, the Packers flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 9 interconference duel with the Kansas City Chiefs (the only team that QB Brett Favre had never beaten). After a scoreless first quarter, Green Bay drew first blood with rookie kicker Mason Crosby getting a 48-yard and a 36-yard field goal. However, the Chiefs would take the lead into halftime as RB Larry Johnson completed a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Packers regained the lead as Favre completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Kansas City regained the lead with QB Damon Huard completing a 30-yard TD pass to Johnson. Green Bay replied with Crosby kicking a 32-yard field goal, yet the Chiefs answered with Huard completing a 17-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez (with RB Priest Holmes getting the 2-point conversion run). The Packers pulled back into the lead as Favre and Jennings hooked up again on a 60-yard TD pass. Afterwards, Crosby made a 45-yard field goal, and CB Charles Woodson returned an interception 46&#160;yards for a touchdown. With the win, the Packers improved to 7-1.  Brett Favre also became the third quarterback to defeat all of the other 31 NFL teams at least once.  Peyton Manning and Tom Brady had been the first two to do so, just hours apart, the week before. The Packers scored 17 points in the final 3:05 on a defense that hadn't given up more than 20 all year. Favre joined Peyton Manning and Tom Brady as quarterbacks who've beaten all 31 other teams in the NFL. Favre rallied the Packers to victory from a fourth-quarter deficit or tie for the fourth time this season and 40th in his career, second only to John Elway's 46 fourth-quarter comebacks. The Packers have won 11 of their last 12 games, dating back to last season. Their sixth straight road wins tie for the second-longest away-from-home streak in team history.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team scored the most points in the second quarter?",
