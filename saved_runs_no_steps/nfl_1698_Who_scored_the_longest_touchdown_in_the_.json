In the first quarter Arizona trailed early as QB Matt Ryan completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White, followed in the second quarter by kicker Matt Bryant hitting a 24-yard field goal. Arizona would reply with RB Tim Hightower getting an 80-yard TD run, but fell further behind when Ryan threw a 19-yard TD pass to FB Jason Snelling, followed by Snelling getting a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter the Cardinals struggled further when Ryan completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to WR Brian Finneran, followed by Bryan nailing a 35-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter Arizona continued to struggle with FB Jason Snelling getting a 7-yard TD run.\n\nQuestion:\nWho scored the longest touchdown in the second quarter?",
