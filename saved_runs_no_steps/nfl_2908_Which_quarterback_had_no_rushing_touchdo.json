    "problem_text": "Context:\nAfter a tough win at home over the Chargers, the Bengals traveled to Baltimore to take on the Ravens.  All of the first half points came for the Bengals only.  They would score in the first quarter Andy Dalton ran for a 7-yard TD for a 7-0 lead.  Followed up in the second quarter when Dalton found Marvin Jones on a 16-yard TD pass for a 14-0 lead at halftime.  The Ravens were able to get on the board in the third quarter when Joe Flacco found Steve Smith Sr. on a 50-yard TD pass for a 14-7 game and the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Ravens took the lead at first coming within 4 when Justin Tucker put a 21-yard field goal through for a 14-10 game and then when C.J. Mosley returned a fumble 41 yards for a TD for a 17-14 lead.  The Bengals retook the lead when Dalton found A. J. Green on an 80-yard TD pass for a 21-17 game before the Ravens went back into the lead when Flacco found Smith Sr. again this time on a 16-yard TD pass for a 24-21 game.  Dalton and Green hooked up on the last score of the game:  A 7-yard TD pass for the final score 28-24. With their 4th straight win over the Ravens, the Bengals improved to 3-0 for the 2nd straight season, and captured their 4th 3-0 start under Marvin Lewis. This was also their first ever 2 game winning streak in Baltimore.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich quarterback had no rushing touchdowns?",
