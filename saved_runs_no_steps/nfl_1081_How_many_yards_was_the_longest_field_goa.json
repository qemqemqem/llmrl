    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their home loss to the Bears, the Colts flew to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome for a Week 2 interconference duel with the Minnesota Vikings.  In the first half, Indianapolis trailed as Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell got a 45-yard and a 27-yard field goal in the first quarter, along with a 53-yard field goal in the second quarter.  It marked the first time that the Colts got shut out in the first half since October 2006. In the third quarter, Minnesota increased its lead with Longwell nailing a 46-yard and a 28-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Indianapolis started to rally as RB Joseph Addai got a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Colts drew closer as QB Peyton Manning completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, followed by a 2-point conversion run by RB Dominic Rhodes.  Afterwards, near the end of game, Indianapolis completed its comeback as kicker Adam Vinatieri nailing the game-winning 47-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?",
