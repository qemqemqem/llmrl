    "problem_text": "Context:\nThe Patriots traveled to Miami to face the Dolphins, looking to clinch the AFC East, playing their first game without Gronkowski since Week 6 vs the Saints. After a Dolphins punt, the Patriots marched 83 yards to the Dolphins 4 on their opening drive, which took half of the quarter, but ended with a Gostkowski field goal. The next four drives of the game ended in punts. Midway through the second quarter, the Dolphins reached the Patriots 24. However, John Denney fumbled the snap and Nate Ebner recovered at the Patriots 31. The Patriots stormed 69 yards, scoring on Brady's 13-yard touchdown pass to Michael Hoomanawanui, increasing the lead to 10-0. The Dolphins got on the board on their next drive, racing 82 yards in just over a minutes, with Tannehill bombing a 39-yard touchdown pass to Wallace, making the score 10-7 Patriots at halftime. The Patriots drove all the way to the Dolphins 20 on their next drive, but Gostkowski missed a 38-yard field goal. The Dolphins managed to drive all the way to the Patriots 14, but could only chalk up a 32-yard field goal, tying the game 10-10. After a Patriots punt, the Dolphins strung together a 10 play, 66-yard drive, scoring on a 2-yard touchdown pass to Daniel Thomas, giving the Dolphins a 17-10 lead a few plays into the fourth quarter. The Patriots responded by driving all the way to the Dolphins 5-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 23-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 17-13. After a Dolphins punt, the Patriots raced 73 yards in just 6 plays, scoring on Brady's 24-yard touchdown pass to Edelman, giving the Patriots a 20-17 lead with just 4:07 remaining in the fourth quarter. However, Gostkowski booted the ensuing kickoff out of bounds, giving the Dolphins the ball at their own 40. Facing a 3rd-and-16 at their own 34, Tannehill hit Brian Hartline for an 11-yard gain, then on 4th-and-5, Tannehill hit Charles Clay for a 6-yard gain and a first-down. Five plays later, Tannehill hit Marcus Thigpen for a 14-yard touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 24-20 lead with 1:15 remaining in the game. Facing a 4th-and-8 at their own 33, Brady hit Amendola for a 12-yard gain. Four plays later, Brady converted at 3rd-and-10 with a 12-yard screen pass to Edelman to the Dolphins 19. Four plays later, facing a 4th-and-5 at the Dolphins 14, Brady was intercepted in the end zone by Michael Thomas with 0:02 seconds left. Tannehill took a knee and the Dolphins won the game. Miami's victory was their first over the Patriots since 2009, having lost the last seven games in the division rivalry.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich team scored the most in the first half?",
