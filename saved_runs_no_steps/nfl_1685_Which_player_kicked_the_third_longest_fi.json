Washington fumbled early in the game, giving the Buccaneers possession of the ball at the Redskins' 10-yard line. Tampa Bay scored on quarterback Josh Johnson's 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Antonio Bryant in the first quarter. Mike Nugent's 37-yard field goal in the second quarter gave the Buccaneers a 10-point lead. In the third quarter, the Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham made a 42-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Jason Campbell completed a 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Chris Cooley. The point after was blocked. The Redskins also scored when Campbell threw a 59-yard pass to wide receiver Santana Moss.  Nugent successfully kicked a 22-yard field goal in the fourth quarter; setting the final score of Washington 16 to Tampa Bay 13. Josh Johnson saw his first NFL start. Jason Campbell finished the day with three interceptions and two touchdowns.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich player kicked the third longest field goal?",
