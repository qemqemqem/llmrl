    "problem_text": "Context:\nLate on 22 October 1923, the military leader of the KP Wasserkante received orders via the regional party leadership to begin the rebellion. Only 300 took an active part in the rebellion. although the Hamburg KPD numbered some 14,000 members. On 23 October at 5:00 a.m., they stormed 26 police precincts and took weapons from 17 of them. There was also activity in Altona and the urban district of Stormarn, where the police stations in Schiffbek and Bramfeld were attacked and weapons taken. In Bad Oldesloe, Ahrensburg and Rahlstedt, train tracks and streets were blockaded. In the town of Bargteheide, insurgents arrested local government leaders and proclaimed the \"Soviet Republic of Stormarn\". In Schiffbek, where the KPD had support, placards were posted to calm residents and to urge support for the uprising, declaring \"Long live Soviet Germany! Long live the Federation of Soviet states of the world! Long live the world revolution!\" Most of the uprising was quelled in a few hours. In Schiffbek, it lasted till just past noon. Only in Barmbek, where the KPD had received some 20% of the vote in the previous election, the insurgents were supported by residents, who helped them build barricades and brought them food. The rebels were able to maintain their position during the entire day, despite the continuous exchange of gunfire. At night, however, convinced of the hopelessness of their situation, they sneaked away. The next day, the police launched a major offensive against empty barricades.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many police did not have their weapons taken from them?",
