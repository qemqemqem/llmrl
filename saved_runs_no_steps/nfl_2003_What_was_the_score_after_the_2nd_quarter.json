    "problem_text": "Context:\nBruce Gradkowski came into the game as Oakland's starter at Quarterback, trying to cap on his gamewinning performance last week vs. St. Louis Arizona started the game with a 102-yard kickoff return from LaRod Stephens-Howling. The Raiders answered quickly though when Gradkowski completed a 22-yard pass to tight-end Zach Miller. This was followed by three field goals, two for Oakland, one for Arizona, and Oakland led 13-10 at the end of the first quarter. Both Gradkowski and Derek Anderson then traded touchdowns and the Raiders led 20-17 at the half. Anderson helped Arizona take the lead late in the third quarter with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Larry Fitzgerald. Arizona led 24-20 at the end of the third quarter. Sebastian Janikowski made the lead 24-23 with another field goal in the fourth quarter. Arizona held on for the win after Janikowski missed a 32-yard field goal as time expired. Both the Raiders and Cardinals committed numerous mistakes, including two muffed punts by Arizona. Oakland committed 11 penalties for 123&#160;yards, Arizona seven for 104.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat was the score after the 2nd quarter ended?",
