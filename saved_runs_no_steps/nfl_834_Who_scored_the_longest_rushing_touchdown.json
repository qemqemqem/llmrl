    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their road win over the Rams, the Seahawks flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 13 duel with the Philadelphia Eagles.  In the first quarter, Seattle took flight after LB Lofa Tatupu intercepted Eagles QB A. J. Feeley on the first play of the game, returning it to the 18-yard line. RB Shaun Alexander cashed in a few plays later with a 2-yard TD run.  The Eagles responded with RB Correll Buckhalter breaking free on a 30-yard TD run.  Following another Tatupu interception of Feeley, QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Bobby Engram.  Philadelphia would end the period with kicker David Akers nailing a 31-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Seattle drove to the Eagles' 22-yard line, but K Josh Brown missed the field goal attempt. After holding the Eagles to a 3 and out, Nate Burleson returned a punt 36 yards to the Eagles' 43-yard line. On the next play, Hasselbeck completing a short pass to Burleson, who took it 43 yards down the left sideline for a TD. The Eagles would cut the lead to 4 on a Feeley 24-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Curtis, and then they drove to the Seahawks' 1-yard line just before the half. The Seahawks stopped the Eagles 4 times to keep the lead at the half. In the third quarter, following a Bobby Engram fumble, Philadelphia took the lead as RB Brian Westbrook galloped away on a 29-yard TD run.  Later, the Seahawks responded with RB Maurice Morris getting a 45-yard TD run and a 28-24 lead.  The teams drove back and forth the rest the game, and the Eagles looked to be on the verge of victory after Westbrook returned a Seattle punt 64 yards to the Seahawks 14-yard line with 1:37 left in the game.
