    "problem_text": "Context:\nTrying to end a six-game losing streak, the Raiders went home for an interconference fight with the St. Louis Rams (who, just like the Raiders, used to play in Los Angeles, California).  After a scoreless first quarter, Oakland's struggles continued as Rams' kicker Jeff Wilkins nailed a 24-yard and a 34-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, the Raiders' problems continued with RB Stephen Jackson getting a 4-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, St. Louis wrapped up the game with Jackson getting a 19-yard TD run.  With their seventh-straight loss, the Raiders fell to 2-12. This marked the third time this season that the Raiders got shut out.\n\nQuestion:\nHow short was the shortest touchdown run?",
