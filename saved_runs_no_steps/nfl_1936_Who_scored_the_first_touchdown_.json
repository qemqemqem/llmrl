    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their home win over the Cowboys, the Vikings flew to Lambeau Field for a Week 7 NFC North Sunday night duel with the Green Bay Packers, as quarterback Brett Favre made his return to take on his former team, in their first meeting on NBC's Sunday Night Football. Minnesota trailed early in the first quarter as Packers running back Brandon Jackson got a 1-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Vikings responded as wide receiver Percy Harvin got a 17-yard touchdown run. Green Bay struck back in the second quarter as quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Andrew Quarless, yet Minnesota took the lead with running back Adrian Peterson getting a 1-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell booting a 28-yard field goal after a bizarre reversal of a touchdown reception by Visanthe Shiancoe. The Packers began the third quarter with Rodgers completing a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings, followed by linebacker Desmond Bishop returning a Favre interception 32 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings would answer with Favre finding wide receiver Randy Moss on a 4-yard touchdown pass. Minnesota tried to rally in the fourth quarter with an apparent 30-yard touchdown pass from Favre to Harvin with 48 seconds left which would have been the game winner, but Harvin had apparently only one foot in bounds, nullifying the touchdown. Favre tried two more times to get into the end zone, but Green Bay's defense held for the win.\n\nQuestion:\nWho scored the first touchdown?",
