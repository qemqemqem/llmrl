    "problem_text": "Context:\nComing off their bye week, the Ravens went home for a Week 8 duel with the undefeated Denver Broncos.  Baltimore took flight in the first half with kicker Steven Hauschka nailing a 43-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 35-yard field goal in the second quarter.  The Ravens would immediately make their domination felt in the third quarter as rookie cornerback Lardarius Webb returned the second half's opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown.  The Broncos would get on the board with running back Knowshon Moreno getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet Baltimore answered with Hauschka booting a 31-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Ravens closed the game out in the fourth quarter as quarterback Joe Flacco found wide receiver Derrick Mason on a 20-yard touchdown pass, while running back Ray Rice got a 7-yard touchdown run.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many more times did the Ravens score in the second half than they did in the first half?",
