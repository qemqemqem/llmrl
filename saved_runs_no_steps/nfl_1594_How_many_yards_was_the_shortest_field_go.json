    "problem_text": "Context:\nHoping to rebound from their tough Sunday night loss to the Cowboys, the Eagles flew to Qualcomm Stadium for a Week 10 interconference duel with the San Diego Chargers.  Philadelphia would trail in the first quarter as Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to fullback Mike Tolbert.  San Diego would add onto their lead in the second quarter with running back LaDainian Tomlinson's 3-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles would get on the board with kicker David Akers getting an 18-yard and a 25-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Chargers went back to work as Tomlinson got a 20-yard touchdown run.  Philadelphia would try to stay close as Akers nailed a 25-yard field goal, but San Diego kept their attack going as Rivers hooked up with wide receiver Legedu Naanee on a 20-yard touchdown pass.  The Eagles' offense would finally get going in the fourth quarter as quarterback Donovan McNabb completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Jeremy Maclin and a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Celek.  However, the Chargers would prove to be too much to handle as kicker Nate Kaeding booted a 29-yard field goal.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many yards was the shortest field goal?",
